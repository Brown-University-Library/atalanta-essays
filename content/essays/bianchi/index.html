        As a physical object, Michael Maier’s captivating <em>Atalanta fugiens</em> is of modest dimensions. It is
        difficult to imagine how three singers could ever have gathered around a copy of Atalanta fugiens to sing its
        canons. Nor is there evidence that anyone attempted to. But Maier’s curious integration of music into his
        enigmatic creation opened it wide indeed, to playfulness of cosmic significance.
      </p>
      <p>
        Maier included fifty three-voice contrapuntal pieces in <em>Atalanta fugiens</em> and structured a subsequent
        treatise, <em>Cantilenae intellectuales</em> (Intellectual Songs, 1622), around the literary conceit of poetic
        “counterpoint” for three voices. Yet he left just a few scattered comments on music and nothing remotely
        resembling a thorough statement of musical philosophy. My task, then, lies in stitching together disparate
        threads, searching for meaningful coherence within the fabric of Maier’s work and against the larger tapestry of
        his world.
      </p>

      <p>
        The tapestry I weave differs significantly from earlier accounts. I place less emphasis upon alchemy (especially
        in its occult formulations), which several fine scholars have already explored.<sup><a href="#"
            class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='Early modern use of “alchemy” and related terms is by no means consistent; this is true of Maier, both within <em>Atalanta</em> and across his writings. For clarity, I therefore follow Principe (<em>Secrets of Alchemy</em>) in using “chymistry” to denote a broad range of chemical and medical practices (including alchemy), and “alchemy” to denote a narrower range of practices associated with chrysopoeia. See also Tilton, <em>Quest for the Phoenix</em>, ch. 1 on the problems of terminology, including Principe’s. Forshaw, <em>“Oratorium”</em>; Godwin, <em>Atalanta</em>; Gouk, <em>Music, Science, and Natural Magic</em>; Tomlinson, Music in Renaissance Magic; Wuidar, <em>Musique et astrologie</em> and “Trasmutazione.”'>1</a></sup>
        Moreover, Maier was more than an (occult) alchemist, and the spacious category of <em>musica</em> offered him
        and his contemporaries a fuller range of possibilities than that label implies. To imagine those possibilities
        requires descending a bit from the realm of cosmic ideas in which Maier is usually placed, and entering into the
        quotidian conditions of early modern social and professional life. I locate Maier’s musical world among people,
        texts, and sounds he is likely to have encountered. These range from the gentlemen and scholars who divined and
        calculated a silent harmony of the heavens, to the humbler artisans who honed the techniques of counterpoint and
        text painting that transformed lofty words and ideas into physical sound. At times, <em>musica</em> manifested
        itself in contradictory, even inimical forms; Maier partook of them all. I therefore aim to suggest multiple
        ways that <em>Atalanta fugiens</em> could have signified in the the wide but coherent constellation of
        cultures—social and professional, aesthetic and scientific, metaphysical and theological—from which musical and
        chymical subcultures took their coordinates.

        It is impossible to write the history of music and alchemy. Both pursuits encompassed a variety of cultural
        practices, of which the <em>Atalanta</em>-object materializes just a narrow selection. And, as we will
        see, both were shaped by common epistemological and social assumptions, according to which garden-variety
        practitioners were mere “mechanics.”<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='See Whitney, “Paradise Restored,” on the relation between liberal and mechanical arts.'>2</a></sup>
        The learned and privileged held them in low regard and considered them to have little intellectual life worth
        recording. Thus, whole realms of cultural production have left behind relatively few evidentiary traces. This is
        especially true at the nexus of chymistry and music. The scarcity of sources has led, on the one hand, to
        overinterpretation of those few that exist. In the case of <em>Atalanta fugiens</em>, one scholar describes the
        canons as “incantations,” evidence that alchemists commonly “incorporated some type of [secret] musical practice
        in their ritual.”<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='Kassler, “Thomas Britton,” 68.'>3</a></sup> At the same time, other scholars have
        dismissed the occasional testimony of a musician’s alchemical activities, as in the correspondence of Maier’s
        contemporary Claudio Monteverdi. The editor of a recent edition of the composer’s letters assures readers that
        <span class="left-space"><br>
          the real attraction of [the pseudo-science] lay not so much in its scientific aspect as in its symbolism and
          its <em>pretence</em> towards a search for perfection . . . Monteverdi’s involvement could not have been all
          that deep, and perhaps . . . in the nature of a pastime . . . part and parcel of an amusing diversion.<sup><a
              href="#" class="foot-note"
              data-text-content='Stevens, <em>Letters of Claudio Monteverdi</em>, 291. Italics mine. Stevens describes alchemy as among the “pseudo-sciences” earlier on the same page. For a reading of these letters that is more sympathetic to alchemy, see Wuidar, “Trasmutazione,” 130–35; for a reevaluation of alchemy’s importance in late seventeenth-century German musical culture, see Yearsley, “Alchemy and Counterpoint.”'>4</a></sup>
        </span>
      </p>

      <p>
        That conclusion is possible, given Monteverdi’s light touch in these letters; it certainly helps to safeguard
        the prescient intelligence one expects from a canonic genius, and especially from the supposed “creator of
        modern music.”<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note" data-text-content='The phrase is taken from the title of Leo Schrade’s landmark biography; for comparisons of Monteverdi’s achievements to those of Galileo, see Tomlinson, <em>Monteverdi</em>, esp. chs. 1 and 10.
                On Jocus severus, see below at note 21.'>5</a></sup> Yet to assume that Monteverdi’s epistolary
        playfulness amounts to mere irony, or mere insincerity, would underestimate the complexity of
        seventeenth-century wit. (Monteverdi, after all, chose his <em>Scherzi musicali</em> (Musical Jests, 1607) as
        the forum for the lengthiest, most defensive statement of musical principles.) This world delighted in profound
        wit and serious jest, as Maier’s titles <em>Lusus serius</em> (1616) and <em>Jocus severus</em> (1617) testify.<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='On <em>Jocus severus</em>, see below at note 21.'>6</a></sup> Metaphors and conceits
        could signify at multiple levels of reality, rendering it difficult for modern scholars to draw firm boundaries
        between underinterpretation and overkill.
      </p>
      <p>
        In Maier’s case, recent research makes that boundary more ambiguous still. Loren Ludwig’s extraordinary
        discovery—that Maier lifted the bulk of <em>Atalanta fugiens’</em> canons from John Farmer’s <em>Diuers &
          sundry waies</em> (1591)—complicates any simple notions about Maier’s beliefs and his claims to authorship. As
        new documents continue to emerge, so does a new, less-idealized Maier: a flesh-and-blood rascal, not just a mind
        consumed with cosmic thoughts. Perhaps the presence of music in this alchemical emblem book records less about
        the author’s musical-metaphysical convictions than about his pressing need to attract a patron by demonstrating
        a unique gift.<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='On gifts and patronage, see Biagioli, <em>Galileo, Courtier</em>, 36–52.'>7</a></sup>
        (Sadly, the expense of printing <em>Atalanta fugiens</em> exacerbated, rather than improved, his dire financial
        straits.<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='Lenke et al., “Newly Discovered Letters,” 18, 30–31.'>8</a></sup>) Whatever Maier’s
        beliefs and motivations, that is to say, he engineered an object capable of provoking conversation and
        reflection far beyond the printed page. To understand the world for which it was designed, we begin by
        reconstructing the musical milieu that Maier himself might have inhabited.

        If we take Maier at his word, he had a firm “grasp [of] both the theory and practice of music.”<sup><a href="#"
            class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='<em>a</em> “Inquam . . . musica<em>m</em> tàm theoricam, quàm practicam . . . capere potero.” Maier, <em>De medicina regia</em>, A3v. Tilton dates this retrospective statement of Maier’s to 1601 (<em>Quest for the Phoenix</em>, 62–64).'>9</a></sup>
        But we know little about his musical life and—in light of his musical borrowings—it appears that we knew even
        less than we’d thought. Nevertheless, using the autobiographical account in Maier’s recently rediscovered <em>De
          medicina regia</em> (On the Regal Medicine, 1609), I attempt to fill out the picture by placing him among figures
        whom he is likely to have known or whose education and career likely resembled his.<sup><a href="#"
            class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='The treatise was rediscovered by Karen Figala and Ulrich Neumann. See “Michael Maier (1569–1622)” and “New Light.” Among useful parallels to Maier’s contemporaries, see Peter Pesic’s account of Kepler’s musical formation in <em>Making of Modern Science</em>, 73–76.'>10</a></sup>
      </p>
      <p>
        As for his intellectual formation, Maier recalled his boyhood studies of the trivium and music at the local
        school.<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note" data-text-content='Maier, <em>De medicina regia</em>, Ar.'>11</a></sup>
        But it isn’t clear whether this instruction was theoretical, practical, or both. Paul Raasveld plausibly
        suggests that Maier was familiar with Johannes Lippius’ <em>Synopsis novae musicae</em> (Synopsis of New Music,
        1612).<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='Raasveld, “Michael Maiers <em>Atalanta</em>,” 362ff.; on Lippius’ musical theories, see below at note 74.'>12</a></sup>
        Yet I find it altogether more likely that Maier’s musical thought was shaped by an important teacher and by a
        fellow student during his years at the University of Rostock (1587–1591). In Rostock he almost certainly would
        have studied medicine and quadrivial subjects under the distinguished physician and mathematician Heinrich
        Brucaeus. Brucaeus published widely in both fields, and Maier later cited his writings.<sup><a href="#"
            class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='Tilton is more emphatic on this point (<em>Quest for the Phoenix</em>, 44–45). Maier’s account of his Rostock years (<em>De medicina regia</em>, Ar–v) does not mention Brucaeus specifically; he mentions, however, wishing to excel in every branch of the disciplines he studied. “Studebam Physica, Mathematica, Astronomica, Logica, ac Medica: In singulis tantum praestitisse volui, quantum alius, qui ex professo ex professo eas scientias tractaret.” Maier, <em>De medicina regia</em>, Av.'>13</a></sup>
        To fulfill his polymathic ambition, Brucaeus pursued music in his scholarship and pedagogy, as revealed in
        <em>Musica theorica</em> (Music Theory), published posthumously in 1609. The short treatise presents Brucaeus’
        exegeses of Euclidian texts. In fact, since <em>Musica theorica</em> consists of lecture materials (possibly in
        a student’s transcription), it may offer a direct glimpse into Maier’s musical education at University:
        resolutely mathematical, focused upon ratios of pitch, rooted in classical sources, without immediate
        application to practice.<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='“ . . . audirem Tractatus Musici Theorici, quem Dominus Henricus Brucaeus . . . quum integram integram Mathesin in manus sumsisset publicè docendam, praelegisset . . . en! is [= Tractatus], sicut ex ore Authoris exceptus fuit.” Burmeister, “Introduction,” (:)2v.'>14</a></sup>
        The editor of <em>Music Theory</em>, Joachim Burmeister, expressed surprise that Brucaeus should write so
        discerningly about musical science despite lacking even rudimentary musical ability.<sup><a href="#"
            class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='“Auctor . . . cum tamen (mirum) canendi peritiâ prorsus destitueretur.” Burmeister, “Introduction,” (:)3r.'>15</a></sup>
        However, the world of the theorist was rarely coterminous that of the practitioner, as we will see.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although not mentioned in previous studies of <em>Atalanta fugiens</em>, Burmeister himself should be a figure
        of considerable interest. A music theorist who later held the post of Kantor in Rostock, he worked as a musician
        in two of the city’s principal churches and studied with Brucaeus during Maier’s time at the University.<sup><a
            href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='Burmeister enrolled in 1586 and took his master’s degree in 1593.'>16</a></sup>
        Burmeister’s <em>Hypomnematum musicae poeticae</em> (Notes on a Synopsis of Musical Poetics, 1599) linked
        incipient notions of triadic harmony to the Trinitarian thought that exercised a profound influence upon Maier’s
        musical metaphysics. It is not far-fetched to imagine young Michael Maier engaging Burmeister and Brucaeus in
        erudite musical conversation.
      </p>
      <p>
        What of his experiences with sounding music? Here, too, evidence is slender. The aviary conceit of his <em>Jocus
          severus</em> might suggest a sensitivity to birdsong.<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='Maier treated birdsong as music, part of a continuum descending from <em>musica divina</em> (<em>Atalanta fugiens</em>, 35). As Eva Leach shows in <em>Sung Birds</em>, there was resistance to this point of view on the grounds that <em>musica</em> implied rationality.'>17</a></sup>
        (On the other hand, birds provided conventional <em>Decknamen</em>, code names for alchemical materials, for
        volatiles.) He mentions having heard the hydraulic organ at the Medicean Villa Pratolino.<sup><a href="#"
            class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='Maier, <em>Symbola aureae mensae</em>, 593 (repeated in <em>Subtilis allegoria</em>, 728); in <em>Jocus severus</em>, he compares the nightingale’s singing to a hydraulic organ (29).'>18</a></sup>
        He must have heard contemporary music in Italy, Prague, and London. His London sojourn was crucial for
        <em>Atalanta fugiens</em>, since it was almost certainly there that he encountered Farmer’s canons.<sup><a
            href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='The last notice of Farmer dates to 1601, so it is unknown whether he was alive during Maier’s visit.'>19</a></sup>
        On the basis of internal evidence, I suspect that he also encountered William Bathe’s <em>A briefe introduction
          to the skill of Song</em> (c. 1596).<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='In <em>Atalanta fugiens</em>, Maier attributes an opinion on the worthiness of musical study to one “Fabius” (8). The only other place I have been able to locate this statement is the title page of Bathe’s <em>Briefe introduction</em>, where it appears with an attribution to “Fabius.” (<a href="/essays/ludwig"
          target="_blank">Loren Ludwig</a> makes the same observation in his essay for this project.) Since Bathe left England for Spain in 1591, it is unlikely that Maier met him. Maier used additional elements from Bathe’s and Farmer’s defenses of music; see below at note 40.'>20</a></sup>
        Bathe’s humble treatise, which offered rough guidance in composing two-voice canons above a plainsong <em>cantus
          firmus</em>, could have come in handy when Maier filled out the blank spaces in <em>Atalanta fugiens</em> (see
        Table 1). In 1611, Maier presented James I with an elaborate poetic greeting, complete with a four-voice canon
        above an ostinato.<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='Adam McLean discovered the canon, which is transcribed in Godwin (<em>Atalanta</em>, 208); the ostinato is unrelated to the plainchant <em>cantus firmus</em> used in <em>Atalanta fugiens</em>.'>21</a></sup>
        Simon Smith speculates that this canon, and perhaps others destined for <em>Atalanta fugiens</em>, may have been
        used in a performance of Shakespeare’s alchemically resonant <em>The Winter’s Tale</em>, given at court in
        1612–1613 to celebrate the union of James’ daughter Elizabeth to Frederick V. Maier was certainly on the scene,
        having been listed among Frederick’s “gentlemen” at the funeral of James’ son Henry in November 1612.<sup><a
            href="#" class="foot-note" data-text-content='Smith, <em>Musical Response</em>, 54–60. '>22</a></sup> Yet it
        seems somewhat improbable that he—rather than one of the fine musicians associated with the English court—would
        have been entrusted with such a task.<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='Here I must mention one such musician, John Bull, due to frequent assertations in the literature that he was involved in alchemy. Music master to both Prince Henry and Princess Elizabeth, Bull composed music for Elizabeth’s wedding. It is indeed possible that Maier and Bull were acquainted. However, I find unconvincing the oft-repeated claims for Bull’s alchemical activities, which rest entirely upon a slender iconographical reading of his 1589 portrait. Cf. British (English) School, <em>Portrait of John Bull</em>, 1589, oil on panel, 54.6 x 44.5 cm, Faculty of Music and Bate Collection of Musical Instruments, University of Oxford.'>23</a></sup>
      </p>
      <p>
        Was Maier sufficiently skilled to have composed canons—even bad ones? In <em>De medicina regia</em>, he claims
        that his mother paid two years’ tuition to an unnamed, “more celebrated school” than that at which he studied
        music and the trivium.<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='“ . . . ad aliam Scholiam celebriorem perrexi.” Maier, <em>De medicina regia</em>, Ar. The possibility of Bordesholm is also raised by Figala and Neumann (“New Light,” 142n26).'>24</a></sup>
        I would suggest the Gymnasium of Bordesholm, just outside Kiel. Although this <em>Fürstenschule</em> served the
        sons of the aristocracy, students also hailed from working-class families, especially those who (like Maier’s)
        served the Holstein court. One such student was Erasmus Sartorius, a choirboy at court. Princely support enabled
        him to attend Bordesholm in the early 1590s, where he also served as organist. Bordesholm prepared him for
        Rostock which, in turn, prepared him for a career resembling Burmeister’s: an important municipal cantorate and
        publication of music treatises that displayed his authorial skill with the sort of rich, allusive Latin prose
        and poetry at which Maier also excelled. It was common in Lutheran lands, well into the eighteenth century, for
        such students to defray tuition by singing in the liturgy. If Maier did so, he would have learned, at minimum,
        to sing melodies from musical notation. Instruction often extended to singing polyphony and, in some cases, to
        the rudiments of contrapuntal composition.
      </p>
      <p>
        Maier claimed that <em>Atalanta fugiens’</em> fugues were given “by my Muse” [<em>dat mea Musa fugas</em>] and
        that he himself carefully “wrote and proofed” them [<em>fugas illas musicales . . . summâ diligentiâ scripsi &
          revidi</em>].<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='Maier, “Epigramma authoris,” <em>Atalanta fugiens</em>, [2]; Dd3r (“Monitio ad Philomusicum”).'>25</a></sup>
        The unacknowledged presence of Farmer’s entire opus within <em>Atalanta fugiens</em> tells a rather different
        story. Maier’s “Muse” was likely no more celestial than a bookstall; in hindsight, we might even take
        <em>scripsi</em> as “copied down.” The choice of Farmer’s obscure print could suggest that he hoped to escape
        detection. The same held for Maier’s friend Johannes Staricius, a poet laureate, chymist, and organist. Portions
        of Staricius’ <em>Newer teutscher weltlicher Lieder</em> (New German Secular Songs, 1609) are neither new nor
        German, but rather consist of unacknowledged borrowings from Thomas Morley’s madrigals and ballets, published in
        the 1590s by the same London firm that printed Bathe’s and Farmer’s work.<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='On Staricius’ relationship with Maier (with examples of their correspondence), see Lenke et al., “Newly Discovered Letters”; on Staricius’ <em>Newer teutscher weltlicher Lieder</em>, see Classen and Richter, <em>Lied und Liederbuch</em>, 268–73.'>26</a></sup>
        Nor can we simply assume that Maier composed the remaining ten pieces; possibly, he commissioned them from some
        as-yet-unknown musician. Since canon was closely associated with recondite learning, contrapuntal “borrowing”
        (with varying degrees of attribution) was a common strategy for authors to present themselves as more skillful
        and erudite than they actually were.<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='I explore musical borrowing, with reference to counterpoint and canon, in “Scholars, Friends, Plagiarists,” 82–85.'>27</a></sup>
      </p>
      <p>
        Maier used all forty of Farmer’s waies, but that still left him ten fugues short. Two flights of fugues, 21–30
        and 31–40, preserve Farmer’s sequence fairly accurately. This could point to an earlier, differently ordered
        incarnation of <em>Atalanta fugiens</em>. Of <em>Atalanta fugiens’</em> first twenty fugues, Maier took only the
        even-numbered from Farmer. He still needed ten fugues to fill in the odd-numbered slots. As it turns out, these
        ten “mystery fugues” are a virtuoso display of incompetence. For instance, before Fugue 11 completes the first
        poetic line, it has already charged through a briar of improbable dissonances and parallel perfect
        intervals—including one instance where all voices move simultaneously in forbidden parallels. The Burmeisters of the era devoted countless pages to warning against such
        solecisms of musical grammar and syntax.<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='See, for instance, Burmeister, <em>Hypomnematum</em>, Dr–D3v.'>28</a></sup> Even allowing
        for Maier’s choice of an archaic idiom in which open intervals are acceptable, it is still a feat to violate so
        many sacrosanct theoretical precepts in so short a space. Fugue 11 certainly merits its epigram: <em>Tear up the
          books!</em>

        did not necessarily need to demonstrate complete mastery of the craft, but only a basic fitness of musical and
        literary conceits. His final flight of borrowings, 41–50, does so imaginatively. Moreover, musical finesse and
        competence, and the technical study required to attain them, once held a very different status. They were the
        domain of the craftsman; the cult of the “Musical Genius” was centuries away. Maier distanced himself from craft
        at the outset of <em>Atalanta fugiens</em>. His imposing self-presentation as “Count, Knight, and Doctor of
        Medicine” bespoke status far above that of professional musicians (<strong>fig. 1</strong>). In a single glance
        it communicates power, erudition, wealth, lineage, renown. It is a façade for his literary performance, as
        expected in an era when the theatrical stage provided the dominant metaphor for public life: <em>theatrum
          mundi</em> [The Great Theater of the World]. It exudes a confident sophistication that belies a hungrier
        reality. Maier had been ennobled, but was not of the nobility. He was a gold embroiderer’s son and, in 1617, the
        ink on his escutcheon was scarcely dry. The escutcheon suggests a storied lineage but was in fact one of Maier’s
        ingenious concoctions. Figala, Neumann, and others have recently unearthed archival documents that allow a peek
        behind the mask.<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='Figala and Neumann, “Michael Maier (1569–1622)” and “New Light”; Lenke et al., “Newly Discovered Letters”; Tilton, <em>Quest for the Phoenix</em>.'>30</a></sup>
        Maier spent his university career fleeing debt and scandal, his mature career chasing patrons. That he dedicated
        <em>Atlanta fugiens</em>, his intricate jewelbox, to the Mühlhausen town council cannot be taken as a sign of
        high status, either financial, professional, or social.

        Seventeenth-century scientific literature often features images that seamlessly connect various branches of
        knowledge. Within many of those enterprises, including music and chymistry, fissures ran between theorists and
        practitioners that tracked neatly with those of social rank. Take the emblem of musico-chymical harmony devised
        by Jacques de Senlecque for Basil Valentine’s <em>Révélation des mystères</em> (Revelation of Mysteries, 1646) (<strong>fig. 2</strong>).<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='<a href="/essays/forshaw" target="_blank">Peter J. Forshaw</a> argues that Senlecque’s engraving was indebted to the much-reproduced image of the “Lab-Oratorium” from Heinrich Khunrath’s <em>Amphitheatrum sapientiae aeternae</em> (1609) (<em>“Oratorium,”</em> 180–81).'>31</a></sup>
        Senlecque intones parallel scales between treatises of seven alchemical authors and seven alchemical
        preparations that result from operations of Paracelsian spagyria. He fills out that sonority with another
        parallel scale for the discipline of music. The scale of a seven-piped organ corresponds to the seven celestial
        bodies, which were in turn associated with the traditional seven metals. The celestial bodies, therefore,
        establish the link between chymistry and music, and of both to the macrocosm. The heavenly <em>organum</em>,
        metaphor for the greater <em>organon</em>, stands as Christian substitute for Apollo’s seven-stringed lyre and
        Pan’s seven pipes.<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='On Newton’s reinterpretation of the latter, see McGuire and Rattansi’s classic article, “Newton and the ‘Pipes of Pan.’”'>32</a></sup>
        It is the warrant for <em>musica instrumentalis</em>, in the form of a seven-stringed, seven-fretted viol.<sup><a
            href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='In fact, the viol stands in for a grander <em>symphonia</em> for “two choirs . . . of seven voices & seven instruments”: “ . . . le concert estant a deux chœurs . . . composé de Sept voix & de Sept instruments; les deux principaux desquels seront la Basse de Viole à Sept Chordes, & un Clavecin.” Senlecque, “L’Imprimeur au lecteur.”'>33</a></sup>
        The visual-verbal pun between the “viol” of music and the “vial” [<em>phial</em>] of chymistry exemplifies
        “profound wit.” The similarity of words that name dissimilar objects is a sign that both draw upon the same
        concealed powers to effect human healing.

      </figure>
      <p>
        Read more assertively, Senlecque’s image forcefully attempts to harmonize what were actually dissonant
        socio-professional relationships in both musical and chymical cultures. While all three scales move in smooth
        parallel motion, they sing in different registers. Chymical <em>theoria</em> appears above, and separated from,
        <em>practica</em>. Likewise, the celestial organ is a disembodied rank of pipes in a realm above the viol, whose
        bow indicates the physical activity of music-making.
      </p>
      <p>
        Early seventeenth-century erudites did not dignify physical labor; they dissociated themselves from its taint.
        One of Maier’s readers exemplifies enduring tensions between theory and practice, musical and chymical. At
        mid-century, Athanasius Kircher touted his numerical system of “automatic” music as more rational than—and
        superior to—the act of composition; likewise, he reported that in the chymical laboratory, he gave the orders
        that menials executed.<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"

        It is increasingly clear that Maier carried out substantial laboratory work—to the dismay of his neighbors—and
        that he was capable of writing about chymistry in straightforward, technical prose. Thus it is significant that
        he located <em>Atalanta fugiens</em> somewhat far “from the world of laboratory practice,” as Lawrence Principe
        observes.<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"

        The printed page offered a more visible forum than the laboratory, making it all the more important for Maier to
        use print as a vehicle to distinguish himself from what Tara Nummedal calls “entrepreneurial chemists.”<sup><a

        It would have been useful for him to have publicly discredited rank-and-file practitioners as <em>betrüger</em> [frauds],
        and he devoted a treatise to doing just that: <em>Examen fucorum pseudo-chymicorum</em> (Swarm of
        Pseudo-Chymical Drones, 1617).

          Of everything that must be understood about the Theoretical part of this Philosophy, the Pseudo-chymist has an
          insufficient or superficial acquaintance, and therefore is here as if deprived of an eye. And I fear that,
          because he would not see much with the other ([as it] is turned toward <em>practice</em>), he is thus blinder
          than a mole. For, in practice, which operations can he execute? Certainly not the Philosophical ones, but
          [instead only] deceptive ones, and those that pertain to this art no more than do straw and chaff to

        In Maier’s distinctive formulation of chemistry, of which <em>Atalanta fugiens</em> is an intense distillation,
        preoccupation with social status is the volatile. The true chymist, he argues, is versed in astronomy, physics,
        geometry, arithmetic, grammar, rhetoric, poetics, philology, logic, medicine.<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"

        Take Maier’s rant, replace <em>pseudo-chymist</em> with <em>pseudo-musicus</em>, and you’ve got yourself a good
        seventeenth-century music treatise. Here, too, privileged theorists denounced common practitioners: the latter
        had debased the ideal of “living musically” to a synonym for gross sensuality. In their sensuality, they relied
        on the fallacious judgment of the ears rather than the intellect. In their utter ignorance of arithmetic,
        geometry, Greek, Latin, and poetics, they maimed <em>musica</em> at every turn. Many theorists of this stamp were nobles
        and aristocrats, or intellectuals in their midst. Among the few composers to win their unalloyed acclaim was Don
        Carlo Gesualdo, the dark prince of Venosa.<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='I base this discussion upon the writings of: Italian Jesuit Giuseppe Biancani, mathematics professor in Parma (“De Mathematicarum,” 63; <em>Sphaera mundi</em>, 387); Spanish-Bohemian nobleman and polymath Juan Caramuel y Lobkowitz, Bishop of Vigevano (<em>Musica</em>, bk. 1, art. 11); Florentine patrician and antiquarian Giovanni Battista Doni, secretary to the College of Cardinals (<em>De praestantia</em>, 46, 100); German Jesuit mathematician and orientalist Athanasius Kircher, professor at the Collegio Romano (<em>Musurgia universalis</em>, 1:547, 562–64, 599, 675).'>39</a></sup>
        Gesualdo’s music went beyond expressing texts; it intensified them through harmonic progressions so unusual as
        to nearly defeat performers. It epitomizes a true <em>musica reservata</em> that “nobly” flouted the economy of
        everyday utility to which the professional was bound. Such attitudes explain the defensive statements, in many
        publications devoted to <em>musica practica</em> (such as Bathe’s and Farmer’s), about the “nobility” of the
        craft.<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"

      <p>
        Nowadays, this theory-practice rift can seem a bit counterintuitive because the categories of “theory” and
        “practice” have shifted. The modern music theory curriculum progressively manipulates intervals to develop such
        skills as improvisation and composition. To the seventeenth-century intellectual, those lay closer to “mere”
        <em>musica practica</em>. True <em>musica theorica</em> or <em>speculativa</em> considered the same intervals,
        but rather as mathematical abstractions and manifestations of a deeper order. Individual compositions amounted
        to epiphenomena, more or less pleasing in their way, but of a far lower order than the objects of <em>musica
          speculativa</em>.<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"

      <p>
        “Sounding number” [<em>numerus sonorus</em>], as Maier’s contemporaries understood that concept, traced back to
        the mathematical thought of Pythagoras. Tradition credited him with discovering that musical intervals could be
        expressed as numerical proportion. The fourth, fifth, and octave formed the <em>tetraktys</em>, an interlocking
        series of ratios [4:3:2:1], whose terms yield the divine number, 10. This discovery, at once scientific and
        metaphysical, formed the basis for the central Pythagorean teaching “All is number.” According to this doctrine,
        musical proportion not only governed musical sound; it was the organizing principle of the heavenly spheres.
      </p>
      <p>
        Early modern thinkers were often deeply syncretic. Because they accounted for Greek learning as deriving from
        Moses and the Biblical Hebrews, they easily folded Pythagorean thought into Scriptural exegesis. Writers in
        mathematical disciplines (including Maier) often invoked Wisdom 11:21, which states that God ordered the
        universe by “number, weight, and measure.”<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='Maier, <em>Cantilenae intellectuales</em>, A2r; <em>Arcana arcanissima</em>, 6, 138; see also Kepler, <em>Harmonices</em>, bk. 2, ch. 59.'>42</a></sup>
        This verse conditioned the interpretation of two other passages. Genesis 4:21–22 tersely describes Jubal as
        “father of them that play upon the harp and the organs,” and his brother Tubalcain as “hammerer and artificer in
        every work of brass and iron.” These offered proof that God had revealed <em>musical science</em> to
        antediluvian Hebrews. The mention of metallic artifice led many to discern a divine revelation of alchemy; the
        mention of “hammering,” to conclude that the frequently conflated Jubal-Tubal actually referred to Pythagoras
        and his musical discovery in the ring of blacksmiths’ hammers.<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='McKinnon, “Jubal vel Pythagoras.”'>43</a></sup> Maier’s genealogies of <em>prisca
          sapientia</em> [pristine or ancient wisdom] sometimes credited Pythagoras with discovering intervals; at
        others, with transmitting the intervals that Hermes discovered (“since all things exist according to weight,
        number, and measure”).<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='On the former, see Maier, <em>Cantilenae intellectuales</em>, A3r; on the latter, <em>Arcana arcanissima</em>, 5–6, 136–38; <em>Symbola aureae mensae</em>, 5–32, 113–18. On the vagaries of <em>prisca sapientia</em> in Maier, see Tilton, <em>Quest for the Phoenix</em>, 80–86.'>44</a></sup>
        In either case, it was no stretch to interpret a third verse, Job 38:37 (“Who can make the harmony of heaven to
        sleep?”), as proof of a silent Pythagorean <em>musica mundana</em> (Music of the Spheres) in the Christian
        cosmos.
      </p>
      <p>
        Pythagorean musical philosophy, in Boethius’ late-Antique formulation, persisted in early-modern university
        curricula. Like the Pythagoreans, Boethius drew from musical mathematics broad and somewhat surprising
        consequences. Here again, we find that basic terms such as “music” and “musician” were once defined quite
        differently. Boethius divided music into three classes along a hierarchical continuum. The Music of the Spheres
        [<em>musica mundana</em>] took pride of place, followed by a music of the human body and soul [<em>musica
          humana</em>], fashioned by God according to harmonious proportions. What we today call “music” [<em>musica
          instrumentalis</em>] occupied the very lowest rung. It appeared most real; in fact, it was the most illusory.
        For Boethius, true <em>musica</em> was a science of mathematical speculation, not the irrational craft of
        music-making. It did not necessarily imply audibility or sound. It was a silent principle of cosmic order.
      </p>
      <p>
        Epistemological distinctions mapped onto those of social class. The true <em>musicus</em> was an aristocratic
        philosopher like Boethius or Maier. The <em>cantor</em>—our “musician”—was a literal and figurative slave, a
        brute bound to the physical production of sensible sound. Notably, given <em>Atalanta fugiens’</em> musical
        conceit, Maier used Boethian rhetoric to attack pseudo-chymists: they were “asses [attempting] the lyre—that is,
        utterly remote from all good learning and intention.”<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='“ . . . pseudo-chymicis (qui in his sunt asini ad lyram, quippe ab omni bona doctrina & intentione alienissimi).” Maier, “Praefatio ad lectorem,” Atalanta fugiens, 7. See further Adolf, “The Ass and the Harp,” and Gibson, “Asinus ad lyram.”'>45</a></sup>
        By contrast, Maier recommends the soundless songs of <em>Cantilenae intellectuales</em> to a deep interior
        reflection [<em>profundâ mente</em>] drawn from Boethius’ <em>Consolation of Philosophy</em>.<sup><a href="#"
            class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='Boethius, <em>Consolation of Philosophy</em> 3.11; see below at note 74 for a fuller translation of Maier’s directive.'>46</a></sup>
        Maier envisioned a musical experience far richer than mere reading:
        <span class="left-space"><br>
          A sort of three-voice musical echo will result within [the reader], affecting and sweetening not so much the
          ears with sound, but rather the mind by an internal sense in the manner of Aspendius, who was said to sing
          within himself. For just as ardent prayers poured forth to God are considered to be cried out (albeit silently
          and without noise), so also are the harmonies of [these] songs to be perceived in the silence of the
          intellect.<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
              data-text-content='“Quae omnia dum Intellectus rationabilium hominum contemplatur & summa cum imis, totum cum partibus, casusaque cum effectibus comparat, Echo quaedam musicalis Trivoca in eo resultat, non tam sono aures, quàm sensu mentem internè afficiens & mulcens, Aspendii more, qui intus cecinisse dicitur: Ut enim ardentes ad Deum preces effusae, etiam tacitae & sine strepitu clamare praesumuntur, ita & in Intellectu cantilenae silentio consonantes percipi.” Maier, <em>Cantilenae intellectuales</em>, A3r.'>47</a></sup>

      </p>
      <p>
        If Maier found it difficult to explain the phenomenon precisely, it will be no easier for us four centuries
        later. Still, it suggests another way to understand the music of <em>Cantilenae intellectuales</em>,
        <em>Hymnosophia</em>, <em>Atalanta fugiens</em>, and, potentially, a great deal more: not quite sounding, not
        quite silent, but somewhere between. Early moderns read poetry with a deep awareness of meter. The quantitative
        meters of Latin verse were trained intensively in the early years of their education, reinforced over a lifetime
        of liturgical hymnody. A musical conceit—even the bare layout of poetry on a page—could stimulate deeply
        inculcated patterns. As the eye moved silently across the pages of <em>Cantilenae intellectuales</em>, the
        reader musicked the poetry, the mind’s ear supplying the rhythms of anacreontic meter and perhaps even the
        melody used to memorize it.<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='A seventeenth-century template for simple musical settings of anacreontic verse is found in Kircher, <em>Musurgia univeralis</em>, 2:42, 84–85, 108–9; I borrow the term “musicking” from Christopher Small.'>48</a></sup>
      </p>
      <p>
        But due to suspicion of the physical in both Greek and Christian traditions, Maier’s contemporaries harbored
        ambivalent attitudes toward <em>sounding</em> music. It emanated a sensual presence capable of corrupting souls
        and an alchemical power capable of ennobling them. Despite the risk, Maier claimed, alchemy and music were
        worthy of <em>liberales</em>—well-educated, well-heeled gentlemen.<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"

        In Lutheran Germany, the requirements of the liturgy somewhat narrowed the rift between <em>musicus</em> and
        <em>cantor</em>. Since women were bound to “keep silent in churches” (1 Corinthians 14:34), the local
        <em>lateinschule</em> [Latin School] or university provided a steady stream of boy trebles for a city’s
        principal churches. This meant that a relatively high proportion of well-educated Lutherans had effectively
        spent their formative years as semi-professional musicians. Moreover, the municipal liturgical machine was
        overseen by the <em>Kantor</em>, an organist-composer whose post frequently required him to teach Latin at the
        school. The latter obligation resulted in a Kantorate that was formally educated to a degree sufficient to
        master the trivium (but not necessarily the advanced disciplines that comprised the quadrivium, physics, and
        metaphysics).<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='Some, such as Burmeister and Sartorius, seem to have surpassed this level. Nevertheless, intellectuals tended to look down upon Kantors, especially those without a university degree; these tensions are widely treated in the literature on J. S. Bach.'>50</a></sup>
        Nevertheless, Maier positioned himself not among Kantors, but rather among the privileged intellectuals who
        devoted Latin treatises to musical metaphysics and mathematics. His London and Prague sojourns brought him into
        the spheres of the two most prominent and controversial: Robert Fludd and Johannes Kepler.<sup><a href="#"

        Soon after <em>Atalanta fugiens’</em> publication, Fludd and Kepler entered a dispute about cosmic harmony that
        would have far-reaching consequences for the conceptualization of music. Both affirmed a universe structured by
        music, but they disagreed about the means to demonstrate it: philosophical speculation and occult
        correspondences (Fludd, <strong>fig. 3a</strong>), or calculation founded upon empirical observation (Kepler,
        <strong>fig. 3b</strong>).

        For our purposes, it is notable that Kepler and his partisans, in attacking Fludd’s work, drew attention to its
        alchemical resonances. Kepler contrasted Fludd’s methodology (concealing Nature’s secrets “in shadowy enigmas”
        after the manner of “Chymists, Hermetics, Paracelsians”) with his own (using mathematics to bring “matters
        shrouded in darkness into the light of understanding”).<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='“Videas . . . [Fluddium] delectari rerum aenigmatibus tenebrosis, cùm ego res ipsas obscuritate involutas in lucem intellectus proferre nitar.

        Pierre Gassendi mocked Fludd for finding hints of “any old consonance” in chymical practices, and expressed
        surprise that he “took pains to express these things on paper.”<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"

        Marin Mersenne approved of Kepler’s method as mathematical, deriving results from “the compass,” whereas Fludd’s
        was “chymical,” using “furnaces and fire.”<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"

      </p>
      <p>
        Nevertheless, scholars overemphasize Fludd and Kepler’s differences at the expense of their significant common
        ground. They shared with each other, and with Maier, fundamental assumptions: that music was a numerical science
        and that it pervaded the cosmic and metaphysical order. “If therefore we sing [in <em>Atalanta fugiens</em>], it
        is not inappropriate,” Maier wrote, “since the Angels sing (as Sacred Writ shows), the heavens sing, as
        Pythagoras maintained, & they tell out the glory of God, as the Psalmist says.”<sup><a href="#"

My translation places the final phrase first. For further similarities between Maier’s and Fludd’s musical thinking, see below at note 66.'>55</a></sup>
        Considered in this context, <em>Atalanta fugiens’</em> combination of alchemy, music and metaphysics doesn’t
        seem so idiosyncratic. Nevertheless, it is difficult to articulate a coherent musical metaphysics from this
        single work. Clues are scattered across the corpus of Maier’s writings, most of which appeared in the narrow
        span of six years, 1616–1622.

        <em>Atalanta fugiens’</em> first emblem bears a cryptic motto from the <em>Tabula smaragdina</em> (Emerald
        Tablet), purportedly the work of Hermes Trismegistus: “The [North] Wind bore it in his belly.” Through emblem
        and epigram (<strong>fig. 4</strong>), Maier explicates the two fundamental substances of Jabirian theory; here,
        the fetus (sulfur) is borne by Boreas (mercury). Maier alludes not only to the material substances from which
        all elements derive but also—since Boreas gestates a human form—to the continuity and interrelation of
        operations divine and human, spiritual and material, celestial and terrestrial.<sup><a href="#"

        This commentary bears comparison to a passage in Thomas Norton’s <em>Ordinall of alchimy</em>, which Maier
        published in Latin translation the same year as <em>Atalanta fugiens</em>. Norton wrote that the chymist should
        combine physical substances according to the rules of artistic and scientific disciplines including arithmetic
        and music.<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='“Coniunge tua Elementa Musice / . . . Et sic compone . . . / Cum regulis, quae sint in Musica / Cum proportionibus causantibus harmoniam / Quibus valde similes proportiones sunt in Alchymia.” Norton, <em>Ordinale</em>, 136–37. I thank Donna Bilak for drawing my attention to Maier’s translation of this passage in <em>Tripus aureas</em>. See also Forshaw, “Oratorium,” 183–89 on Norton, the double octave in <em>Atalanta fugiens</em>, and another in Maier’s <em>Viatorium</em> (1618).'>58</a></sup>
        Among the musical proportions “very like” those of chymistry are the octave, fifth, and fourth; combined, they
        yield the double octave, which is both the interval of Maier’s discourse and the first harmonic sonority of the
        corresponding fugue.
      </p>
      <p>
        More important than the specific interval (to which we shall return) is the unity of knowledge that Maier’s
        comments presuppose. This presumed unity was especially intimate among the quadrivial disciplines, speaking as
        they did a single language of number. Seventeenth-century intellectual culture witnessed the apex of the
        polymathic ideal: the mastery of universal rather than specialist knowledge. This enabled music to serve as a
        category of analysis in a variety of disciplines. For this reason, mathematicians and astronomers (such as
        Kepler, Kircher, and Mersenne) were also the prominent music theorists. Also for this reason, medics and
        chymists (such as Fludd and Maier) incorporated music into their work. Music, chymistry, and medicine all aimed
        to channel great and sometimes mysterious forces toward transformations. The venerable concept of <em>musica
          humana</em> therefore warranted explorations of <em>iatromusica</em>, music applied to medicine. Maier falls
        into a long tradition of thinkers who mapped the mathematics of pitch onto the body and healing
        practices.<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='Most notably, Marsilio Ficino; see Tomlinson, <em>Music in Renaissance Magic</em>, ch. 4.'>59</a></sup>
        In his memorably titled <em>Civitas corporis humani, a tyrannide arthritica vindicata</em> (City of the Human
        Body Liberated from Arthritic Tyranny, 1621), Maier compared body parts to polyphonic voices. “Just as in music
        sweet-sounding harmony arises from various notes [together] and not just a single one,” he wrote, “so also in
        [this] city.”<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"

        This pleasing metaphor stated a higher reality that had anatomical manifestations and practical medical
        applications.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Atalanta fugiens</em> opened with the idea, central also to Fludd’s writings, that “man is a compendium of
        the universe.”<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"

        woman to the traditional Vitruvian man. Hermes Trismegistus inscribes them within a circle (for the soul’s
        divine nature) and a square (for the body’s material nature). They are further inscribed by a triangle and a
        circle, all of which have chymical significance.<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='De Jong, <em>Michael Maier’s “Atalanta fugiens,”</em> 166–76.'>62</a></sup> Hermes works
        with square, compass, and quadrant, the traditional tools of geometer, architect, and astronomer. Man, then, is
        a “compendium of the universe” precisely by virtue of musical proportions: they shape our bodies and bewitch our
        souls. (In <em>Lusus serius</em> (A Serious Jest), Maier places this Platonic idea in the mouth of a sheep.)<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note" data-text-content='Maier, <em>Lusus serius</em>, 17–18.'>63</a></sup>

        As usual, the specific details are tougher to work out and require gathering fragments scattered across his
        other writings. In <em>Cantilenae intellectuales</em> he posits a specific macro-microcosmic relationship
        between planets and bodily organs. A major third, perfect fifth, and octave result from the proportional
        distances of Earth to Moon, Sun, and fixed stars, and from feet to liver, heart, and brain.<sup><a href="#"
            class="foot-note" data-text-content='Maier, <em>Cantilenae intellectuales</em>, A2r–v.'>64</a></sup> The ratios
        extend the <em>tetraktys</em> by one term [5:4:3:2:1]; the intervals form the harmonic triad that would hold
        such significance for Maier. He explains these relationships more fully in an unlikely place, <em>Verum
          inventum, hoc est munera Germaniae</em> (The True Discovery, or The Gifts of Germany, 1619). Here he praises
        German contributions to civilization, especially Charlemagne’s brilliant establishment of the Holy Roman Empire
        and its governance by seven electors. The electors didn’t always see eye to eye, so Maier turned to planetary
        motions to explain a <em>musica politica</em> in which occasional dissonances between individual voices
        contribute to overall harmony.<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='Maier, <em>Verum inventum</em>, 66–73; cf. Kepler’s very different formulation of <em>musica politica, Harmonices</em> 3:86–103.'>65</a></sup>
        Music functions similarly in heaven and cities, literal and arthritic. The triadic harmony from <em>Cantilenae
          intellectuales</em> fits precisely within the planetary ratios of <em>Verum inventum</em>. Both, moreover,
        correspond exactly to the middle portion of Fludd’s celestial monochord (<strong>fig. 3b</strong>). Furthermore,
        Maier described his ratios as “measured not so much arithmetically or geometrically as physically [i.e.,
        qualitatively],” which is essentially the explanation Fludd offered for his own work in <em>Veritatis
          proscenium</em> (The Stage of Truth, 1621).<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='Ammann, “Musical Theory and Philosophy,” 212–13.'>66</a></sup> In retrospect, the
        double-octave ambitus of Fludd’s cosmic monochord offers insight into Maier’s chymical double octave. This is
        not to say that Maier took his ideas from Fludd’s work, although he certainly came to know it.<sup><a href="#"
            class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='Lenke, et al., “Newly Discovered Letters,” 11–12, 33; Figala and Neumann, “New Light,” 45.'>67</a></sup>
        But it does suggest that his scattered observations on musical mathematics were, to some degree, coherently
        integrated with his ideas on medicine, chymistry, and astronomy.

        If <em>musica instrumentalis</em> was the lowest form of <em>musica</em>, it nonetheless existed on a continuum
        with higher forms. The final sections of this paper harmonize high and low, silent and sounding, through two
        specific musical techniques used in the <em>Atalanta fugiens</em>: canon and text painting.
      </p>
      <p>
        As I have said, canon justly carried strong associations with recondite learning. First, there is the sheer
        difficulty of writing good imitative counterpoint: success requires foreseeing the potentials and pitfalls
        implicit in a canonic subject so that polyphony grows “automatically” from a thematic seed, according to a
        grammar of consonance, dissonance, and harmonic progression. It’s useful to reiterate—if only because models of
        musical listening have changed since then—that every element of musical grammar could be represented as
        numerical proportion. When Maier’s contemporaries defined music as <em>sounding number</em>, this is what they
        meant. Listened to in this way, music has little to do with subjective self-expression. It is an artful dance of
        fixed ratios.
      </p>
      <p>
        Second, throughout its long history, composers invested canon with symbolic significance. Resolutions and even
        subjects might be encrypted in allusive emblems, oracular mottos, shadowy enigmas, and other so-called
        hieroglyphs. Thus, canon cast an aura of the venerable and erudite. At the same time, it offered a socially
        exclusive forum for wit and play, which Laurie Stras describes as unfolding in “an almost ritualistic display of
        knowledge, wit, and rhetorical skill.”<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='Stras, “Artifice, Humour and Play, ” 214.'>68</a></sup> The musical object, therefore,
        receded in importance before the external actions it provoked.
      </p>
      <p>
        The simultaneity of hermeneutic ambiguity and ambition reminds us that Maier borrowed a musical technique whose
        true significance might lie somewhere other than its sounding surface. It suited his quest for things “august,
        sublime, sacred, rare, and concealed.”<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='“ . . . subtilia, augusta, sacra, rara & abstrusa.” Maier, “Praefatio ad lectorem,” <em>Atalanta fugiens</em>, 7.'>69</a></sup>
        Its “secrets” were to be pondered orally, aurally, visually, and intellectually, holding out the promise of
        passing from sonic pleasure to intellectual enlightenment.<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='“Auribus [fugae] tuis, oculisque Emblemata prostent, / At ratio arcanas expetat inde notas: / Sensibus haec objecta tuli, intellectus ut illis / Illicibus caperet, quae preciosa latent.” Maier, “Epigramma authoris,” <em>Atalanta fugiens</em>, [2]. '>70</a></sup>
        Yet Maier may have also suspected that <em>Atalanta fugiens’</em> readers would not appreciate too much
        subtlety. He solved for them the riddles of canonic resolution: he presented all vocal parts on a single page,
        stated explicitly the canonic procedures, and translated the epigrams into the vernacular.
      </p>
      <p>
        The three vocal lines themselves may harbor “sacred, sublime” theological meaning in addition to their
        personification of mythical figures. As we have seen, Maier posited harmonic triads in the macro- and microcosm.
        The triad was only just then being theorized as an independent musical object. Even so, several writers had
        already discerned great significance in a single consonant sonority arising from three simultaneous pitches.
        Burmeister heard it as a sort of musical hypostasis:
        <span class="left-space"><br>
          The harmonic art is both divine and a divine gift . . . its most hidden mysteries flow from the venerable
          Trinity, whence music takes its origin . . . Of the things that concern this art, all consist of the ternary
          number, are constituted by it, fulfill their ends through it.<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
              data-text-content='“[Ars harmonica] in illâ latentia mysteria eandem ex venerandâ Trinitate scaturiisse & originem inde primam traxisse . . . Circa quae occupata haec Ars est, ea omnia in ternario numero consistunt, sunt constituta, officia sua exsequuntur.” Burmeister, <em>Hypomnematum</em>, A2r–v (glossing the preceding <em>Epigramma de musices origine</em> (title page, verso). Lippius accorded the triad similar significance (<em>Synopsis novae musicae</em>, G5r); Kepler, by contrast, rejected it (<em>Harmonices</em>, bk. 3, ch. 3). '>71</a></sup>
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        Trinitarian symbolism looms large in Maier’s collections of poetic “songs.” He dedicated <em>Hymnosophia</em> to
        the “one and triune God.” His <em>Cantilenae intellectuales</em> consists of three “triads” of three songs
        (<em>cantilenae</em>) for three voices: Venus (high), Pisces (middle), and Leo (low). (Elsewhere, Maier credits
        Hermes himself with establishing this tripartite division of voices.<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='Maier, <em>Arcana arcanissima</em>, 5; Rebotier highlights other classical resonances in the tertiary musical numbers of <em>Cantilenae intellectuales</em>, such as Plato’s <em>Timaeus</em>.'>72</a></sup>)
        In the final triad, which addresses the Trinity, the bass (Leo) sings of eternal joys such as “the ear has not
        heard / and have evaded all senses.”<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='“Quae non audiit auris, / Et sensus fugit omnis.” Maier, <em>Cantilenae intellectuales</em>, 9. Gravis. 27.'>73</a></sup>
        And so, Maier must abandon entirely the realm of <em>musica instrumentalis</em>, which had embellished
        <em>Atalanta fugiens</em>. The <em>Cantilenae intellectuales</em> include no musical notation; they are a silent
        music “not so much for the audible voice, as for deep reflection.”<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='“. . . non tàm altâ voce, quàm profundâ mente dictatae.” Maier, <em>Cantilenae intellectuales</em>, title page.'>74</a></sup>
      </p>
      <p>
        The richest, but most elusive, Trinitarian imagery may lie in the Golden Apple of <em>Atalanta fugiens</em>. The
        three-voice <em>cantilenae</em>, obviously, form numerous harmonic triads. The two canonic voices (Atalanta and
        Hippomenes) are always accompanied by a slow-moving fragment (<em>Pomum</em>) from an ancient Gregorian Kyrie.
        The Kyrie text, a tripartite invocation whose individual sections are uttered three times, had been used in
        chymical works that Maier knew.<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='Forshaw, “<em>Oratorium</em>,” 181–82.'>75</a></sup>
      </p>
      <p>
        The Kyrie melody used in <em>Atalanta fugiens</em>, the <em>Cunctipotens genitor Deus</em> (All-Powerful
        Creator), was also sung to a Trinitarian trope that addresses God as “creator of all things,” Christ as “healer”
        and manifestation of Divine wisdom [<em>Sophia</em>], and the Holy Spirit as “advancing flame, fount of life,
        purifying force.” This theological imagery could easily take on medical and chymical significance. Both melody
        and text endured in Lutheran hymnody as <em>O ewiger barmherziger Gott</em> (O eternal, merciful God). Are these
        Trinitarian resonances among the “secrets” Maier promised? Was he even aware of them? If so, the amalgam of
        chymical and Trinitarian symbolism suggests that something more than simple convenience motivated Maier’s
        musical borrowings. But since neither he nor Farmer discussed the chant or text, it remains a mystery.

      <p>
        With <em>Atalanta fugiens</em>, Maier engineered a multimedia object whose elements interact across the
        sensorium in complex ways. Textual and visual elements could, as we have seen, stimulate an internal sense of
        hearing. The fifty fugues, in turn, animated static images with dramatic temporality and, through the technique
        of text painting (or “madrigalisms”), made the visual audible.
      </p>
      <p>
        Maier’s musical ingenuity apparently did not lie in compositional skill. It lay rather in his ability to convert
        Farmer’s untexted and somewhat abstract canons into a complex mythological and chymical allegory. To do so, he
        employed devices of musical mimesis whereby notes and pitches take up the visual burden of the emblem and
        poetry. The music imitates the text through the contour of vocal lines and general contrapuntal procedure,
        rather than through harmony. On the printed page, Maier presented the music synoptically, following the format
        used by Farmer and Bathe. Unlike a modern score, this format does not enable the reader to “hear” the harmonic
        flow with the mind’s ear. Nevertheless, it allows her to see the music’s most important expressive features.
      </p>
      <p>
        The strong visual component reveals the influence of <em>musica poetica</em> upon Maier. For theorists of
        <em>musica poetica</em> such as Burmeister, the composer was a rhetorician with the same aims as the preacher or
        poet. These can be summarized with three Classical commonplaces. <em>Docere, movere, delectare</em>: the orator
        should simultaneously teach, move, and delight, according to Cicero and Augustine. <em>Ut pictura poesis</em>:
        writing should aspire to the vividness of painting for Horace, and even—<em>sub oculos subiiciendis</em>—seem to
        place the subject itself before the eyes, in Quintilian’s view.<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='Cicero, in varying formulations. E.g, <em>De optimo genere oratorium</em> 1.3, 5.16, and <em>Orator</em> 21.69; Augustine, <em>De doctrina christiana</em> 4.34–35; Horace, <em>Ars poetica</em> l.361; Quintilian, <em>Institutio oratoria</em> 8.6.19.'>76</a></sup>
      </p>
      <p>
        Maier employed text painting, an effective and obvious tool, at the level of individual word and overarching
        idea.<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='Burmeister’s formulation of <em>musica poetica</em> concerned less text painting and more the use of rhetorical devices to classify and analyze structural features and technical procedures used in composition. As this aspect of the tradition is of limited relevance to the music of <em>Atalanta fugiens</em>, I do not explore it here. See McCreless, “Music and Rhetoric,” for an excellent overview of music and rhetoric; Bartel, <em>Musical-Rhetorical Figures</em>, for source texts and analysis; Vickers, “Figures of Rhetoric,” for important qualifications about the applicability of rhetoric to music.'>77</a></sup>
        At times, canonic procedure itself expresses simple textual ideas such as likeness (<em>imitare</em>, Fugue 3)
        and conjunction (<em>conjunge</em>, Fugue 4). At other times, it expresses more complex concepts. In Fugue 10,
        Hippomenes’ voice rising out of Atalanta’s gives a musical emblem for “mercury from mercury, fire from fire,”
        while the whole musical complex is a fit image for the great “machine of the world” [<em>machina . . .
          mundi</em>].<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='“ . . . ignem igni, Mercurium Mercurio.” Maier, <em>Atalanta fugiens</em>, 49.'>78</a></sup>
      </p>
      <p>
        Maier either tailored his poetry to the shape of the vocal lines or chose canons that fit poetry he had already
        written. Words signifying speed, flight, fire, and suddenness are often paired with rapid melismas. Motion by
        seconds suits <em>binis</em> in Fugue 15; the leaping subject of Fugue 27 misses the sense of <em>luxuriat</em>
        but captures the clumsy gait of the Emblem’s footless man.

<section class="text-section">
  <div class="container">
    <div class="content">
      <p>
        The demands of strophic poetry complicated Maier’s task. Each fugue set only one or two lines of the six-line
        epigrams, requiring each piece to be sung several times to different words. In Epigram 7, Maier places images of
        flight and fall at roughly the same position in each couplet.<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='“ . . . Jovis ALES . . . / . . . voluit se tollere pennis . . . / . . . volans redit in nidem, quem liquerat . . . ” Maier, <em>Atalanta fugiens</em>, 37.'>79</a></sup>
        As a result, each lands near a generically appropriate melisma. On the other hand, and especially in the earlier
        fugues, the expressive relation of text and music seems more neutral. Sometimes a single piece contains both
        congruities and incongruities. In Fugue 16, images of flight [<em>quae volat</em>] and immobility
        [<em>immotus</em>] are fitted to quick melismatic ascents. Such
        moments call interpretive criteria into question. Are we reading too deeply into this music, having already
        decided that it is a sphinx waiting to be decoded? Then again, Maier himself created that impression at the
        outset: since the fugues concealed “precious secrets,” they warranted “seeing, reading, meditation,
        understanding, and discerning” (and only then, “singing and listening”).<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='“ . . . videnda, legenda, meditanda, intelligenda, dijudicanda.” Maier, <em>Atalanta fugiens</em>, [1]. “At ratio arcanas expectat inde notas: / Sensibus haec objecta tuli, intellectus ut illis / Illicibus caperet, quae preciosa latent.” Maier, “Epigramma authoris,” <em>Atalanta fugiens</em>, [2].'>80</a></sup>
        Thus he cleverly shifted the burden of meaning-making onto readers—contemporaneous and modern—who can solve
        riddles he never posed.
      </p>

      {{< bianchi-music-3 >}}

      <p>
        Nevertheless, the final ten fugues leave no doubt that an intricate musical allegory is present. Maier gathered
        together the most “artificial” (that is, artful) of Farmer’s waies to illustrate the dramatic climax of the
        Atalanta myth. They fully display Maier’s ingenuity, as Hildemarie Streich’s reading demonstrates.<sup><a
            href="#" class="foot-note" data-text-content='Streich, “Introduction,” 50–78.'>81</a></sup> Through
        <em>recherché</em> contrapuntal devices such as retrograde motion, thematic inversion, and even a sort of
        prolation canon, we “see” Hippomenes catch up to fleet-footed Atalanta (Fugue 47), who hesitates before the
        golden apples he throws. Large-scale structural and procedural images are accented by subtler details. As
        Atalanta and Hippomenes speed and slacken by turns, the apple remains more or less constant, like gold itself;
        it bears a melody in Dorian, the mode associated with the Sun, from which gold takes its sign.

        Such techniques were part of the broader arsenal of <em>musica poetica</em>, for which several German
        commentators provided guidelines and copious examples.<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='For example: Kircher, <em>Musurgia universalis</em>, 1:599, 2:144–45; Nucius, <em>Musices poeticae</em>, G3v; Schoensleder (who relies heavily upon Nucius), <em>Architectonice musices universalis</em>, 177.'>82</a></sup>
        The lion’s share came from the music of Orlando Lassus, easily the most famous composer of Maier’s world. The
        physician Samuel Quickelberg praised Lassus’ ability to “express the Psalms so fittingly by adapting the music
        to the subject and text, drawing out the force of each affect, and by placing the subject before the eyes as if
        in real life.”<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='“[Psalmi] adeo appositè . . . ad res et verba accommodando, singulorum affectuum vim exprimendo, rem quasi actam ante oculos ponendo, expressit.” Quickelberg, <em>Declaratio</em>, 4v.'>83</a></sup>
        In his famous <em>Tristis est anima mea</em> (My soul is sorrowful), a <em>fuga</em> “emblematizes” Christ’s
        prediction that his disciples will abandon him [<em>vos fugam capietur</em>]. The descending profile of the
        subject makes each of the eleven imitative entries (Judas has already betrayed Christ) appear to fade into the
        distance. Lassus’ motets enjoyed great popularity in German-speaking lands; they were widely anthologized and
        frequently sung in Lutheran services.<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='The two motets I discuss, <em>Tristis est anima mea</em> and <em>In me transierunt,</em> were among the most famous of these, discussed by many theorists (e.g., Burmeister, Calvisius, Kepler, Nucius, Sartorius, Schoensleder). The collections from which they were drawn, RISM 1565b and 1562/1570b, were perhaps Lassus’ most widely anthologized prints.'>84</a></sup>
        Theorists such as Burmeister and Sartorius cited his motets by the dozens, clearly expecting readers to have
        encountered them in choir.<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='It is likely his motets were performed in Rostock during the late sixteenth century; the university library holds several Lassus prints owned by Duke Johann Albrecht I of Mecklenburg, dated 1574.'>85</a></sup>
        They are the only polyphonic music mentioned by Kepler, for whom (as D. P. Walker argues) the invention of
        polyphony was of epochal significance since it was founded in the same archetypes as the Harmony of the Spheres,
        “the geometric beauties coeternal with the Creator.”<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='Walker, <em>Studies in Musical Science</em>, 40. Lassus’ motets are cited frequently in <em>Exercitationes musicae</em> (1600) by the musician and astronomer Seth Calvisius, a good friend of Kepler’s.'>86</a></sup>
        Indeed, Peter Pesic speculates that Kepler considered the semitones of Lassus’ <em>In me transierunt</em> (Thy
        wrath has passed over me) “a powerful treatment of the song of the Earth, embedding the earthly semitone in a
        rich constellation of sonorities that suggest the full universal harmony . . . [a sign] of terrestrial
        dissonance that can be reconciled in celestial harmony.”<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='Pesic, <em>Making of Modern Science</em>, 81–82. '>87</a></sup> It is difficult to
        imagine that Maier, in his studies and in worship, would not have encountered Lassus’ music frequently.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some contemporaneous critics, such as Vincenzo Galilei (father of the astronomer), ridiculed text painting as
        ineffective; many contemporary scholars have even more difficulty accepting this somewhat remote means of
        expression. In the monumental <em>Oxford History of Western Music</em> (2005), Richard Taruskin, analyzing the
        extravagant plague-paintings of Handel’s <em>Israel in Egypt</em> (1739), concludes that the technique is a
        rather juvenile gimmick:
        <span class="left-space"><br>
          Tediously cataloguing the means by which such vivid effects are achieved has the same dampening effect as does the explanation of a joke . . . [yet] it may also serve a good purpose if it forces us to realize and confront, through our annoyance . . . that these marvelous and musically epochal illustrations are indeed, for the most part, no more (and no less) than jokes . . . they depend on mechanisms of humor: puns . . . wit . . . caricature.<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
              data-text-content='Taruskin, <em>Oxford History</em>, 2:321.'>88</a></sup>
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        It’s an understandable attitude. Since the nineteenth century, music has staked its special claim to aesthetic
        autonomy upon a capacity to bypass the explicit, verbal, and visual, and to generate abstract meaning from
        “pure” harmony and form.<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='I do not attribute this view to Taruskin (at least, not uncritically), since he has subjected ideologies of absolute music to searching interrogation in his work on performance practice. Nevertheless, abstract musical meaning clearly carries a premium for him. In his work on Shostakovich he criticizes strict “referentialist” readings (“Public Lies”) and even declares that “music in the post-Beethovenian symphonic tradition . . . was perhaps the most potent medium of artistic expression ever devised” (“Shostakovich and Us,” 10).'>89</a></sup>
        That was not the seventeenth-century view. Theirs was a <em>logos</em> culture, founded upon the Word, in which
        pure instrumental music had little value; full of sound, it might ultimately signify nothing.<sup><a href="#"
            class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='Much Renaissance instrumental music (including Farmer’s waies) refers to, or derives from, texted vocal music. For a long view of musical mimesis, its contradictions, and decline, see Goehr, <em>Imaginary Museum</em>, 131–60.'>90</a></sup>
        From this vantage, one might even conclude that, far from committing mercenary plagiarism, Maier
        <em>improved</em> Farmer’s music by discerning or even creating its latent meanings. The mechanisms of
        seventeenth-century wit implied more than humor, and mimesis provoked delight precisely because the text-music
        similitudes upon which it depended were grounded in deeper continuities. Explaining the devices of <em>musica
          poetica</em>, far from dulling delight, offered social occasions to refine it. Likewise, the “analogical
        harmonies” frequently posited between chymistry and theology, as Principe writes,
        <span class="left-space"><br>
          [were] much more than a metaphor, allegory, or rhetorical conceit . . . The connective analogy . . . functions
          as a <em>proof</em>, transmitting the sure existence of one to the sure existence of the other . . . [This]
          expresses a keen difference between modern and early modern understandings of metaphors and analogies. The
          modern world considers such metaphors and analogies to be creations of the human mind . . . [For early modern
          chymists] they are neither arbitrary nor products of human imagination—they exist independently as real
          connections in the fabric of the world itself. They lie there hidden, waiting to be discovered.<sup><a
              href="#" class="foot-note" data-text-content='Principe, <em>Secrets of Alchemy</em>, 201.'>91</a></sup>
        </span>
      </p>

        Music served as the ur-metaphor for harmony itself, hence the widespread conviction that rationally organized,
        sounding number could have a necessary, rather than contingent, connection to the words and ideas that it
        accompanied. (Now we consider them merely to be “expressed.”) From Maier’s London comes a rare testimony as to
        how idea and word became incarnate sound. In the preface to his <em>Gradualia ac cantiones sacrae</em> [. . .]
        <em>liber primus</em> (First Book of Sacred Songs and Gradual Motets, 1610), William Byrd reflected that:
        <span class="left-space"><br>
          With Sacred words . . . nothing is suitable but a celestial harmony, insofar as we can attain to it. I have
          learned by experience, moreover, that a force most abstruse and recondite inheres in those very words such
          that, cogitating upon things divine, and diligently and seriously turning them over, by some means all the
          most fitting notes [<em>numeri</em>] hasten, as if of their own will, and freely offer themselves to a soul by
          no means inactive or unskilled.<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
              data-text-content='“Ita profecto, Sacris sententiis, quibus Dei ipsius, caelestiumque Civium, laudes decantantur; nulla nisi caelestis quaedam (quantum eniti possumus) harmonia conventiat. Porro, illis ipsis sententiis (ut experiendo didici) adeo abstrusa atque recondita vis inest; ut divina cogitanti, diligenterque ac serio pervolutanti; nescio quonam modo, aptissimi quique numeri, quasi sponte accurrant sua; animoque minime ignavo, atque inerti, liberaliter ipsi sese offerant.” Byrd, <em>Gradualia</em>, A2r.'>92</a></sup>
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        In a short space Byrd captures many of the ideas at which I have been grasping: words themselves possess
        inherent power. Fitting them to suitable music requires an act of cogitation in the recesses of mind and soul.
        Celestial harmony, though it ultimately evades musical sound, manifests itself as number. “Number” presumably
        refers not only to the proportions of individual intervals, but also to the extended expressive devices that
        Byrd used so beautifully. And yet he does not speak of himself as creator-composer. Having tuned mind and soul
        to heavenly harmony, he becomes the aeolian harp here below.
      </p>
      <p>
        It’s a weighty load to lay on Maier’s rickety fugues. And it would require extraordinary transhistorical empathy
        to experience <em>Atalanta fuugiens’</em> music with ears so tuned. That world is gone. But we can still marvel
        at Maier’s books and the sheer possibility that <em>Atalanta fugiens</em> opened for readers. With an ambitious
        little print in hand, they could play <em>musica</em> in its many manifestations. Maier offered canons and
        cantilenas to tickle the ear, edify the educated mind, and fill the soul with harmonies surpassing mortal sense.
