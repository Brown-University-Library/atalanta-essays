					<a id="introduction"></a>
					<p><em>Atalanta fugiens</em> proposes at least two ways of reading its contents.
					[Figure 1<span class="strike">: <em>Atalanta</em> title page</span>] First and foremost, Maier’s title
					page offers up a story. The engravings tell the tale of Atalanta,
					Hippomenes, and a trio of apples, while the title itself, <em>Atalanta
					fleeing</em>, puts Atalanta in motion, thereby inviting the reader to follow
					her flight to the final pages of the book. Even as the title page
					(literally) frames Maier’s masterpiece with a straightforward visual
					narrative, however, it immediately suggests a very different mode of
					reading as well. “Adapted partly for the eyes and intellect…partly for
					the ears and the soul’s recreation,” Maier’s title continues, the “New
					Emblems on the Secrets of Nature” within were to be “seen, read,
					reflected upon, comprehended, weighed, sung, and heard.”<sup class="footnote-sup is-inactive" data-footnote-trigger="1">1</sup> With this
					subtitle, then, Maier underscores the fact that <em>Atalanta fugiens</em> is
					also a collection of emblems, a genre that demands of its reader not
					flight and forward motion, but pause, lingering, and stillness.
					Moreover, the emblematic mode of reading demands multiple senses, not
					just the intellect or eyes, but also the voice and ears. In the preface
					that follows, Maier pointed to the potential rewards of reading in these
					complicated ways, expressing his wish that, “men of letters prize and
					value these figures, which serve thus to the intellect and to several
					senses, so that great things are to be hoped for from them, both as to
					utility and as to delight.”<sup class="footnote-sup is-inactive" data-footnote-trigger="2">2</sup></p>

					<p class="article-text">We might think of these two modes of reading as horizontal and vertical.
					The horizontal mode encourages the reader to turn the page, reading the
					emblems sequentially in search of a narrative thread across multiple
					emblems, while the vertical mode asks the reader to linger on a single
					emblem in order to explore connections among its parts. This essay will
					explore these two approaches to reading <em>Atalanta fugiens</em>, arguing that
					their juxtaposition transforms <em>Atalanta fugiens</em> into a flexible
					instrument for generating new knowledge about chymistry. It is
					significant, however, that both modes of reading require the reader to
					activate multiple senses – not only the intellect, but also the eye and
					ear. This, I argue, makes <em>Atalanta fugiens</em> into a commentary on the
					place of reading and writing – and their relationship to other bodily
					ways of knowing - in the production of chymical knowledge.<sup class="footnote-sup is-inactive" data-footnote-trigger="3">3</sup> <em>Atalanta
					fugiens</em> cultivated particular habits of mind and body, making a serious
					point that chymical truths were divine truths, and that the chymist must
					deploy the intellect and the senses to uncover chymical secrets. In
					showing his readers how to read <em>Atalanta fugiens</em>, in other words,
					Maier taught them how to practice chymistry, and ultimately to feed both
					the intellect and the soul with new truths about nature’s chymical
					arcana.</p>

				<div class="article">
					<p class="article-text">Maier was in fact quite explicit about how he thought aspiring
					chymists<sup class="footnote-sup is-inactive" data-footnote-trigger="4">4</sup> should read his book. His title page and epigram point
					towards the most straightforward horizontal way to approach the book,
					which is to follow the story of the race, the consummation of Atalanta
					and Hippomenes’ love and, finally, their ultimate transformation into
					lions.<sup class="footnote-sup is-inactive" data-footnote-trigger="5">5</sup> The book first sets out this theme in the images on the title
					page. We see the Garden of the Hesperides (guarded by a many-headed
					dragon, Ladon), Venus, Cybele’s temple, Atalanta and Hippomenes (both
					during their race and after their transformation into lions), all of
					which outline the tale to follow. Turning the page, however, the reader
					finds not images but words: Maier’s verse epigram, which expands the
					visual cues on the title page to alert the reader to his basic chymical
					interpretation. Atalanta represents philosophical mercury and Hippomenes
					philosophical sulfur, Maier explains, the two elemental qualities of
					matter that the alchemist must combine in order to produce the
					philosophers’ stone. By linking Atalanta and Hippomenes’ union and
					transformation into lions to the alchemist’s production of the
					philosophers’ stone, Maier suggests that a skillful chymical
					interpretation of the lovers’ tale might reveal how to make this most
					precious of alchemical desiderata.</p>

					<p>Proceeding to the emblems themselves, the reader finally comes to the
					third element of the book: the music. It, too, initially seems to
					reinforce Maier’s suggestion that the emblems will divulge alchemical
					secrets via the tale of Atalanta and Hippomones. Turning the page to
					Emblem I and scanning left to right, the reader’s eye first falls upon
					the music and the marginal labels for the three voices: “Atalanta, or
					voice fleeing,” “Hippomenes, or voice following,” and “the apple thrown,
					or voice delaying.” By now, these characters would be familiar, and by
					placing his melodies in their mouths, Maier seems to suggests that the
					interplay of the three voices, together with image and text, will drive
					<em>Atalanta fugiens</em> forward and fulfill the promise of Maier’s title page
					to unfold the alchemical meaning of the story of Atalanta and
					Hippomenes.</p>

					<p><em>Atalanta fugiens</em> immediately complicates this proposal, however, for
					it turns out that the story of Atalanta and Hippomenes does not, in
					fact, carry through the emblems. It is tempting to imagine, for example,
					that the order of voices in the canons would mirror Ovid’s plot, so that
					Atalanta’s voice would begin the canon when she is in the lead, the
					apple part would begin when Hippomenes tosses them in front of Atalanta,
					and, eventually, Hippomones would begin the canons as he surges ahead to
					take the lead. This is not the structure of the canons, however. Rather,
					the apple is nearly always the lead voice, followed by Atalanta, then
					Hippomenes, foiling any neat correlation between the order of the voices
					and the shifting lead in the race. Nor do Atalanta, Hippomenes, and the
					Apple sing about their contest and its fallout; rather, their lyrics,
					which come from the related epigrams, are about chymical epistemology,
					processes, and materials. Finally, while the images in the emblems are
					full of classicized figures and landscapes, Atalanta, Hippomones, and
					the goddesses who shape their narrative never appear after the title
					page. In short, the conceit of <em>Atalanta fugiens</em> and Maier’s initial
					frame for his chymical treatise falls away almost immediately, leaving
					the reader without the promised narrative thread to follow through the
					fifty emblems.</p>

					</div>

					<p>Maier’s bait and switch is productive, however, causing the reader to
					stumble for a moment, to pause and consider how to proceed without
					Atalanta as the promised guide. Fortunately, the experienced reader
					could recover her footing quickly by drawing on experience with the two
					genres that informed the structure of <em>Atalanta fugiens</em>: emblems and
					illustrated alchemical texts. The emblem book was the most obvious model
					for reading <em>Atalanta fugiens,</em> given the fact that Maier refers to his
					book as “New Emblems on the Secrets of Nature.” The fashionable print
					genre of the emblem book emerged out of older traditions such as the
					Greek epigram, hieroglyphics, <em>imprese</em>, florilegia, medals, and
					heraldry and exploded in the wake of Andrea Alciato’s 1531 <em>Emblematum
					liber</em>.<sup class="footnote-sup is-inactive" data-footnote-trigger="6">6</sup> [Figure 2] In general, collections of emblems were not meant to be
					read vertically, that is one at a time and top to bottom, rather than
					sequentially, one emblem after the next. <strong>[link to Alexandra’s 101
					here]</strong> Typically, emblems used the motto-<em>pictura</em>-epigram format to
					convey truths about anything from love to politics and then to impress
					those insights upon the reader’s memory. The relationships among the
					three parts were often enigmatic, spurring the reader to reflection,
					creativity, and play, and making even a single emblem a perfect game in
					learned circles by providing fodder for erudite displays of
					virtuosity.<sup class="footnote-sup is-inactive" data-footnote-trigger="7">7</sup> Maier’s readers may also have been accustomed to
					thinking about alchemy, in particular, with both words and images,
					particularly in the German-speaking lands, where the alchemical
					illustrated poem, or <em>Bildgedicht</em>, emerged. This late medieval
					tradition is epitomized by the <em>Rosarium philosophorum</em>, which wove
					together quotes from older alchemical texts with a series of twenty
					images (themselves “quotes” from earlier manuscripts), and found its way
					into print with Part II of <em>De Alchemia Opuscula complura veterum
					philosophorum&#8230;</em> (Frankfurt, 1550). [Figure 3] The sequence of images in the <em>Rosarium philosophorum</em>
					suggested a horizontal reading, as they followed the union, death, and
					resurrection, and transformation of Sol and Luna into the philosophers’
					stone. <em>Atalanta fugiens</em> was hardly <em>sui generis</em>, in other words, but
					rather rested on two well-established traditions, the humanist emblem
					and illustrated alchemical texts, both of which would have prepared
					readers/viewers for the kinds of vertical and horizontal reading that
					Maier’s emblems demanded.<sup class="footnote-sup is-inactive" data-footnote-trigger="8">8</sup></p>

					<div class="figure">

					</div>

					<p>Readers of <em>Atalanta fugiens</em> who were new to chymistry and mostly
					familiar with emblem books (rather alchemical <em>Bildgedichte</em>) likely
					would have approached any given emblem vertically. That is to say, they
					would have begun by reading the motto at the top, probably in Latin, but
					perhaps also (or instead) with a glance to the left to read it in
					German. Next, their eyes would have fallen on the image or <em>pictura</em>,
					which reinforced the message of the motto, and then, finally, on the
					epigram and discourses below, which expanded on the motto’s meaning.
					Emblem 11 offers a good example of how this works [Figure 4: Emblem 11:
					first 2 pages.] The Latin motto, “Make Latona White and Rip Up the
					Books,” is repeated in the <em>pictura</em>, where we see a woman seated in the
					center, being washed on the left by another classical figure. At her
					feet she has two children, one of whom has the head of a sun, and the
					other a moon on her head. On the right, a third classical figure is
					ripping up books. The <em>pictura</em> divides neatly into two halves, right
					under the ampersand of the motto, closely linking the bifurcated image
					to the motto above. [could add an illustration showing this]</p>

					<p>The Latin epigram below the <em>picture</em> gives more detail, but the learned
					reader would have understood Maier’s classical reference immediately.
					Latona is the mother of Apollo and Diana (gods of sun and moon),
					represented as the twins at her feet. The beginning of the epigram
					confirms this: “There is no one who does not know the twin offspring of
					Latona,/ Who were sired by Jove, as the old story goes.”<sup class="footnote-sup is-inactive" data-footnote-trigger="9">9</sup> A reader
					familiar with the alchemical corpus, moreover, would have recognized
					Maier’s clever word play as well. The motto, “Make Latona White, and Rip
					up the Books,” cites a well-known alchemical injunction warning against
					confusing or misleading books: “Make Laton white and rip up the books,
					that your hearts may not be destroyed.”<sup class="footnote-sup is-inactive" data-footnote-trigger="10">10</sup> Laton (or latten) is a
					yellow alloy of gold and silver that some alchemists believed must be
					purified further to produce the philosophers’ stone.<sup class="footnote-sup is-inactive" data-footnote-trigger="11">11</sup> Maier makes a
					slight adjustment, however, changing “Laton” into “Latona,” which gives
					him the opportunity to put a classicizing spin on chymical materials.
					“Some say that the face of this offspring, the light of the sun, mixed
					with the moon, has black spots,” he continues; in other words, Latona
					can produce sun and moon, or gold and silver, but she is impure, flecked
					with dark spots on her face.<sup class="footnote-sup is-inactive" data-footnote-trigger="12">12</sup> “Therefore,” Maier concludes, “see to
					it that you whiten Latona/ condemn and rip up the books, which are
					giving ambiguity/ and let there not be delay.”<sup class="footnote-sup is-inactive" data-footnote-trigger="13">13</sup> The text and image
					on the right side of Emblem 11, then, may be read as a proposal for
					action, an injunction to set books aside and manipulate matter in the
					laboratory (in this case, whitening and purifying an impure alloy as a
					step towards producing the philosophers’ stone and, ultimately, gold and
					silver).</p>

					<p>This kind of emblematic vertical reading guided readers down through the
					parts of any given emblem in <em>Atalanta fugiens</em>, leading them deeper
					into its chymical secrets. Maier’s inclusion of music, however, made
					even this kind of vertical reading more complex. What if a European
					reader, accustomed to reading left to right, began with the German motto
					on the upper left, his eye then scrolling down through the music to the
					German epigram before moving across to the Latin version on the right
					that replaced the music with an image? What made <em>Atalanta fugiens</em>
					unique among emblem books and alchemical <em>Bildgedichte</em>, after all, was
					Maier’s inclusion of music, so it seems fitting that a reader might have
					begun there, and not with the more familiar motto, image, and epigram on
					the right. Starting on the left, the reader would find the familiar
					canon format, with the Apple leading, then Atalanta, followed by
					Hippomenes. Their voices and melodies are framed above and below with
					German verse, but they sing in Latin, and this encourages the reader’s
					eye to wander down and to the right to the Latin epigram that provided
					the lyrics. Moreover, Atalanta, Hippomones, and the Apple sing about
					chymistry, namely Laton(a) and the value of laboratory praxis over
					confusing books. If we remember that Maier’s readers would have
					encountered fifty emblems in <em>Atalanta fugiens</em>, then this repeated
					slippage in the music from Ovid’s tale into the laboratory becomes
					something of its own <em>cantus firmus</em>, a steady and recurrent reminder
					that Maier’s book is really about chymistry, despite its literary
					trappings.</p>

					<p>Let us imagine a different kind of reader, however: someone familiar
					with alchemical texts or <em>Bildgedichte</em> such as the <em>Rosarium
					philosophorum,</em> and thus expecting the emblems in <em>Atalanta fugiens</em> to
					outline a series of steps, perhaps for producing the philosophers’
					stone. By Maier’s day, moreover, even the emblem genre had begun to move
					in this direction, evolving from its original form as a collection of
					discreet and self-contained individual emblems, into more coherent
					thematic collections. [cite example?] This imaginary reader may have
					been inclined to dwell less on text and image in a single emblem, but
					rather to horizontally instead, locating connections across multiple
					emblems. This possibility is in fact what made <em>Atalanta fugiens</em>
					especially promising. By framing his collection of emblems with the
					narrative of Atalanta and Hippomenes, telling his readers that the
					lovers tale should be understood as a method for making the
					philosophers’ stone, and then reminding them of this connection again
					and again at the outset of each of the fifty fugues, Maier suggested
					that there <em>was</em> a narrative linking his emblems after all. Certainly,
					Atalanta and Hippomenes disappeared after the opening pages, but perhaps
					the emblems told a tale of chymical processes instead, a step by step
					series of instructions for making the philosophers’ stone.</p>

					<p>Maier’s readers, in short, may have approached <em>Atalanta fugiens</em> with
					different kinds of expertise and expectations, and this would have
					produced different kinds of readings and different kinds of lessons. If
					we envision that our reader has just finished reading and pondering
					Emblem 11, for example, where might he go from there? Perhaps he would
					simply flip the page to follow Atalanta and Hippomones into Emblem 12,
					reading the emblems sequentially. He also might have decided to obey
					Maier’s exhortation to set aside confusing books entirely for the
					laboratory, putting down <em>Atalanta fugiens</em> and stoking a fire instead.
					On the other hand, this reader may well have chosen to remain within
					<em>Atalanta fugiens</em>, at least for the moment; that is, instead of
					proceeding from Emblem 11 to Emblem 12 (thus proceeding “in order”), he
					might have jumped from Emblem 11 into other parts of the book. He might
					have returned back to the title page, for example, where the many-headed
					dragon Ladon sits in the Garden of the Hesperides guarding the golden
					apples, to ponder yet another dimension of Maier’s play on Laton/Latona.
					[Figure 1: title page of <em>Atalanta</em>] Or, this same reader might have
					flipped ahead in the book instead from Emblem 11 to Emblem 25 [Figure
					5: Emblem 25/XXV], “The Dragon does not die, if it is not killed by its
					brother and sister, i.e. Sol and Luna.” In this emblem, we see Latona’s
					twins Sol and Luna again, now all grown up, and attempting to bludgeon a
					dragon who, we are told, “does not die if it is not killed by its
					brother and sister, i.e. Sol and Luna.” This dragon’s tail recalls
					Ladon’s on the title page, but Maier’s epigram tells us that the dragon
					here represents philosophical mercury, which can only be coagulated with
					Sol and Luna. Maier is again pointing to the laboratory, but one wonders
					how this step is related to the one in Emblem 11 before, or, for that
					matter, any of the others in between? Perhaps there is a chymical
					narrative threaded through the book after all, if one only knew how to
					find it?</p>

					<p>My point here is not to answer these questions, to “figure out” the
					secrets that Maier embedded in his complex book. Clearly, there was no
					single way to read <em>Atalanta fugiens,</em> which drew on both the genre of
					the emblem book and the alchemical <em>Bildgedicht</em> (not to mention the
					feint that it was about Atalanta and Hippomenes) to shape readers’
					expectations. In fact, the open-ended nature of <em>Atalanta fugiens</em> and
					the infinite number of links, layers, and hidden meanings embedded in it
					deliberately resists any possibility of “solving” the puzzle (although
					it is fun to try). Rather, my point is that, despite its claim to be the
					story of Atalanta and Hippomenes, the structure and content of <em>Atalanta
					fugiens</em> encourages its readers to read both vertically and
					horizontally, that is, not only to linger within a single emblem to
					consider internal connections among its visual, textual, and musical
					parts, but also to read across multiple emblems. Moreover, even this
					latter kind of horizontal reading offered numerous possibilities. One
					need not read sequentially (although one could), but could also skip
					around, flip back and forth, and construct groupings out of emblems
					otherwise dispersed throughout the book. In short, reading <em>Atalanta
					fugiens</em> for connections and juxtapositions across and within emblems
					turns the book into a tool, an instrument for multiplying meanings and
					endlessly generating new insights into nature, and possibly even
					producing valuable chymical materials in the laboratory.</p>

						<p>Maier preferred the terms <em>chymicus</em> and <em>ars chymica</em> (or, more negatively, <em>pseudo-chymicus</em>) to <em>alchemist</em> or <em>alchemie</em>.

The analogy, in other words, breaks down a bit. <a href="http://diglib.hab.de/drucke/196-quod-1s/start.htm?image=00055">http://diglib.hab.de/drucke/196-quod-1s/start.htm?image=00055</a>  Accessed 14.
