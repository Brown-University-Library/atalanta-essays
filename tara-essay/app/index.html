					<p><em>Atalanta fugiens</em> proposes at least two ways of reading its contents.
					<span class="figure-tag" data-figure-tag="1">[Figure 1<span class="strike">: <em>Atalanta</em> title page</span>]</span> First and foremost, Maier’s title
					page offers up a story. The engravings tell the tale of Atalanta,
					Hippomenes, and a trio of apples, while the title itself, <em>Atalanta
					fleeing</em>, puts Atalanta in motion, thereby inviting the reader to follow
					her flight to the final pages of the book. Even as the title page
					(literally) frames Maier’s masterpiece with a straightforward visual
					narrative, however, it immediately suggests a very different mode of
					reading as well. “Adapted partly for the eyes and intellect…partly for
					the ears and the soul’s recreation,” Maier’s title continues, the “New
					Emblems on the Secrets of Nature” within were to be “seen, read,
					reflected upon, comprehended, weighed, sung, and heard.”<sup class="footnote-sup is-inactive" data-footnote-trigger="1">1</sup> With this
					subtitle, then, Maier underscores the fact that <em>Atalanta fugiens</em> is
					also a collection of emblems, a genre that demands of its reader not
					flight and forward motion, but pause, lingering, and stillness.
					Moreover, the emblematic mode of reading demands multiple senses, not
					just the intellect or eyes, but also the voice and ears. In the preface
					that follows, Maier pointed to the potential rewards of reading in these
					complicated ways, expressing his wish that, “men of letters prize and
					value these figures, which serve thus to the intellect and to several
					senses, so that great things are to be hoped for from them, both as to
					utility and as to delight.”<sup class="footnote-sup is-inactive" data-footnote-trigger="2">2</sup></p>

					<p class="article-text">We might think of these two modes of reading as horizontal and vertical.
					The horizontal mode encourages the reader to turn the page, reading the
					emblems sequentially in search of a narrative thread across multiple
					emblems, while the vertical mode asks the reader to linger on a single
					emblem in order to explore connections among its parts. This essay will
					explore these two approaches to reading <em>Atalanta fugiens</em>, arguing that
					their juxtaposition transforms <em>Atalanta fugiens</em> into a flexible
					instrument for generating new knowledge about chymistry. It is
					significant, however, that both modes of reading require the reader to
					activate multiple senses – not only the intellect, but also the eye and
					ear. This, I argue, makes <em>Atalanta fugiens</em> into a commentary on the
					place of reading and writing – and their relationship to other bodily
					ways of knowing - in the production of chymical knowledge.<sup class="footnote-sup is-inactive" data-footnote-trigger="3">3</sup> <em>Atalanta
					fugiens</em> cultivated particular habits of mind and body, making a serious
					point that chymical truths were divine truths, and that the chymist must
					deploy the intellect and the senses to uncover chymical secrets. In
					showing his readers how to read <em>Atalanta fugiens</em>, in other words,
					Maier taught them how to practice chymistry, and ultimately to feed both
					the intellect and the soul with new truths about nature’s chymical
					arcana.</p>

				<div class="article">
					<p class="article-text">Maier was in fact quite explicit about how he thought aspiring
					chymists<sup class="footnote-sup is-inactive" data-footnote-trigger="4">4</sup> should read his book. His title page and epigram point
					towards the most straightforward horizontal way to approach the book,
					which is to follow the story of the race, the consummation of Atalanta
					and Hippomenes’ love and, finally, their ultimate transformation into
					lions.<sup class="footnote-sup is-inactive" data-footnote-trigger="5">5</sup> The book first sets out this theme in the images on the title
					page. We see the Garden of the Hesperides (guarded by a many-headed
					dragon, Ladon), Venus, Cybele’s temple, Atalanta and Hippomenes (both
					during their race and after their transformation into lions), all of
					which outline the tale to follow. Turning the page, however, the reader
					finds not images but words: Maier’s verse epigram, which expands the
					visual cues on the title page to alert the reader to his basic chymical
					interpretation. Atalanta represents philosophical mercury and Hippomenes
					philosophical sulfur, Maier explains, the two elemental qualities of
					matter that the alchemist must combine in order to produce the
					philosophers’ stone. By linking Atalanta and Hippomenes’ union and
					transformation into lions to the alchemist’s production of the
					philosophers’ stone, Maier suggests that a skillful chymical
					interpretation of the lovers’ tale might reveal how to make this most
					precious of alchemical desiderata.</p>

					<p>Proceeding to the emblems themselves, the reader finally comes to the
					third element of the book: the music. It, too, initially seems to
					reinforce Maier’s suggestion that the emblems will divulge alchemical
					secrets via the tale of Atalanta and Hippomones. Turning the page to
					Emblem I and scanning left to right, the reader’s eye first falls upon
					the music and the marginal labels for the three voices: “Atalanta, or
					voice fleeing,” “Hippomenes, or voice following,” and “the apple thrown,
					or voice delaying.” By now, these characters would be familiar, and by
					placing his melodies in their mouths, Maier seems to suggests that the
					interplay of the three voices, together with image and text, will drive
					<em>Atalanta fugiens</em> forward and fulfill the promise of Maier’s title page
					to unfold the alchemical meaning of the story of Atalanta and
					Hippomenes.</p>

					<p><em>Atalanta fugiens</em> immediately complicates this proposal, however, for
					it turns out that the story of Atalanta and Hippomenes does not, in
					fact, carry through the emblems. It is tempting to imagine, for example,
					that the order of voices in the canons would mirror Ovid’s plot, so that
					Atalanta’s voice would begin the canon when she is in the lead, the
					apple part would begin when Hippomenes tosses them in front of Atalanta,
					and, eventually, Hippomones would begin the canons as he surges ahead to
					take the lead. This is not the structure of the canons, however. Rather,
					the apple is nearly always the lead voice, followed by Atalanta, then
					Hippomenes, foiling any neat correlation between the order of the voices
					and the shifting lead in the race. Nor do Atalanta, Hippomenes, and the
					Apple sing about their contest and its fallout; rather, their lyrics,
					which come from the related epigrams, are about chymical epistemology,
					processes, and materials. Finally, while the images in the emblems are
					full of classicized figures and landscapes, Atalanta, Hippomones, and
					the goddesses who shape their narrative never appear after the title
					page. In short, the conceit of <em>Atalanta fugiens</em> and Maier’s initial
					frame for his chymical treatise falls away almost immediately, leaving
					the reader without the promised narrative thread to follow through the
					fifty emblems.</p>

					</div>

					<p>Maier’s bait and switch is productive, however, causing the reader to
					stumble for a moment, to pause and consider how to proceed without
					Atalanta as the promised guide. Fortunately, the experienced reader
					could recover her footing quickly by drawing on experience with the two
					genres that informed the structure of <em>Atalanta fugiens</em>: emblems and
					illustrated alchemical texts. The emblem book was the most obvious model
					for reading <em>Atalanta fugiens,</em> given the fact that Maier refers to his
					book as “New Emblems on the Secrets of Nature.” The fashionable print
					genre of the emblem book emerged out of older traditions such as the
					Greek epigram, hieroglyphics, <em>imprese</em>, florilegia, medals, and
					heraldry and exploded in the wake of Andrea Alciato’s 1531 <em>Emblematum
					liber</em>.<sup class="footnote-sup is-inactive" data-footnote-trigger="6">6</sup> [Figure 2] In general, collections of emblems were not meant to be
					read vertically, that is one at a time and top to bottom, rather than
					sequentially, one emblem after the next. <strong>[link to Alexandra’s 101
					here]</strong> Typically, emblems used the motto-<em>pictura</em>-epigram format to
					convey truths about anything from love to politics and then to impress
					those insights upon the reader’s memory. The relationships among the
					three parts were often enigmatic, spurring the reader to reflection,
					creativity, and play, and making even a single emblem a perfect game in
					learned circles by providing fodder for erudite displays of
					virtuosity.<sup class="footnote-sup is-inactive" data-footnote-trigger="7">7</sup> Maier’s readers may also have been accustomed to
					thinking about alchemy, in particular, with both words and images,
					particularly in the German-speaking lands, where the alchemical
					illustrated poem, or <em>Bildgedicht</em>, emerged. This late medieval
					tradition is epitomized by the <em>Rosarium philosophorum</em>, which wove
					together quotes from older alchemical texts with a series of twenty
					images (themselves “quotes” from earlier manuscripts), and found its way
					into print with Part II of <em>De Alchemia Opuscula complura veterum
					philosophorum&#8230;</em> (Frankfurt, 1550). [Figure 3] The sequence of images in the <em>Rosarium philosophorum</em>
					suggested a horizontal reading, as they followed the union, death, and
					resurrection, and transformation of Sol and Luna into the philosophers’
					stone. <em>Atalanta fugiens</em> was hardly <em>sui generis</em>, in other words, but
					rather rested on two well-established traditions, the humanist emblem
					and illustrated alchemical texts, both of which would have prepared
					readers/viewers for the kinds of vertical and horizontal reading that
					Maier’s emblems demanded.<sup class="footnote-sup is-inactive" data-footnote-trigger="8">8</sup></p>

					<div class="figure">
						<div><img src="img/Fig 3 Rosarium Coniunctio sive Coitus.jpg" /></div>

					</div>

					<p>Readers of <em>Atalanta fugiens</em> who were new to chymistry and mostly
					familiar with emblem books (rather alchemical <em>Bildgedichte</em>) likely
					would have approached any given emblem vertically. That is to say, they
					would have begun by reading the motto at the top, probably in Latin, but
					perhaps also (or instead) with a glance to the left to read it in
					German. Next, their eyes would have fallen on the image or <em>pictura</em>,
					which reinforced the message of the motto, and then, finally, on the
					epigram and discourses below, which expanded on the motto’s meaning.
					Emblem 11 offers a good example of how this works [Figure 4: Emblem 11:
					first 2 pages.] The Latin motto, “Make Latona White and Rip Up the
					Books,” is repeated in the <em>pictura</em>, where we see a woman seated in the
					center, being washed on the left by another classical figure. At her
					feet she has two children, one of whom has the head of a sun, and the
					other a moon on her head. On the right, a third classical figure is
					ripping up books. The <em>pictura</em> divides neatly into two halves, right
					under the ampersand of the motto, closely linking the bifurcated image
					to the motto above. [could add an illustration showing this]</p>

					<p>The Latin epigram below the <em>picture</em> gives more detail, but the learned
					reader would have understood Maier’s classical reference immediately.
					Latona is the mother of Apollo and Diana (gods of sun and moon),
					represented as the twins at her feet. The beginning of the epigram
					confirms this: “There is no one who does not know the twin offspring of
					Latona,/ Who were sired by Jove, as the old story goes.”<sup class="footnote-sup is-inactive" data-footnote-trigger="9">9</sup> A reader
					familiar with the alchemical corpus, moreover, would have recognized
					Maier’s clever word play as well. The motto, “Make Latona White, and Rip
					up the Books,” cites a well-known alchemical injunction warning against
					confusing or misleading books: “Make Laton white and rip up the books,
					that your hearts may not be destroyed.”<sup class="footnote-sup is-inactive" data-footnote-trigger="10">10</sup> Laton (or latten) is a
					yellow alloy of gold and silver that some alchemists believed must be
					purified further to produce the philosophers’ stone.<sup class="footnote-sup is-inactive" data-footnote-trigger="11">11</sup> Maier makes a
					slight adjustment, however, changing “Laton” into “Latona,” which gives
					him the opportunity to put a classicizing spin on chymical materials.
					“Some say that the face of this offspring, the light of the sun, mixed
					with the moon, has black spots,” he continues; in other words, Latona
					can produce sun and moon, or gold and silver, but she is impure, flecked
					with dark spots on her face.<sup class="footnote-sup is-inactive" data-footnote-trigger="12">12</sup> “Therefore,” Maier concludes, “see to
					it that you whiten Latona/ condemn and rip up the books, which are
					giving ambiguity/ and let there not be delay.”<sup class="footnote-sup is-inactive" data-footnote-trigger="13">13</sup> The text and image
					on the right side of Emblem 11, then, may be read as a proposal for
					action, an injunction to set books aside and manipulate matter in the
					laboratory (in this case, whitening and purifying an impure alloy as a
					step towards producing the philosophers’ stone and, ultimately, gold and
					silver).</p>

					<p>This kind of emblematic vertical reading guided readers down through the
					parts of any given emblem in <em>Atalanta fugiens</em>, leading them deeper
					into its chymical secrets. Maier’s inclusion of music, however, made
					even this kind of vertical reading more complex. What if a European
					reader, accustomed to reading left to right, began with the German motto
					on the upper left, his eye then scrolling down through the music to the
					German epigram before moving across to the Latin version on the right
					that replaced the music with an image? What made <em>Atalanta fugiens</em>
					unique among emblem books and alchemical <em>Bildgedichte</em>, after all, was
					Maier’s inclusion of music, so it seems fitting that a reader might have
					begun there, and not with the more familiar motto, image, and epigram on
					the right. Starting on the left, the reader would find the familiar
					canon format, with the Apple leading, then Atalanta, followed by
					Hippomenes. Their voices and melodies are framed above and below with
					German verse, but they sing in Latin, and this encourages the reader’s
					eye to wander down and to the right to the Latin epigram that provided
					the lyrics. Moreover, Atalanta, Hippomones, and the Apple sing about
					chymistry, namely Laton(a) and the value of laboratory praxis over
					confusing books. If we remember that Maier’s readers would have
					encountered fifty emblems in <em>Atalanta fugiens</em>, then this repeated
					slippage in the music from Ovid’s tale into the laboratory becomes
					something of its own <em>cantus firmus</em>, a steady and recurrent reminder
					that Maier’s book is really about chymistry, despite its literary
					trappings.</p>

					<p>Let us imagine a different kind of reader, however: someone familiar
					with alchemical texts or <em>Bildgedichte</em> such as the <em>Rosarium
					philosophorum,</em> and thus expecting the emblems in <em>Atalanta fugiens</em> to
					outline a series of steps, perhaps for producing the philosophers’
					stone. By Maier’s day, moreover, even the emblem genre had begun to move
					in this direction, evolving from its original form as a collection of
					discreet and self-contained individual emblems, into more coherent
					thematic collections. [cite example?] This imaginary reader may have
					been inclined to dwell less on text and image in a single emblem, but
					rather to horizontally instead, locating connections across multiple
					emblems. This possibility is in fact what made <em>Atalanta fugiens</em>
					especially promising. By framing his collection of emblems with the
					narrative of Atalanta and Hippomenes, telling his readers that the
					lovers tale should be understood as a method for making the
					philosophers’ stone, and then reminding them of this connection again
					and again at the outset of each of the fifty fugues, Maier suggested
					that there <em>was</em> a narrative linking his emblems after all. Certainly,
					Atalanta and Hippomenes disappeared after the opening pages, but perhaps
					the emblems told a tale of chymical processes instead, a step by step
					series of instructions for making the philosophers’ stone.</p>

					<p>Maier’s readers, in short, may have approached <em>Atalanta fugiens</em> with
					different kinds of expertise and expectations, and this would have
					produced different kinds of readings and different kinds of lessons. If
					we envision that our reader has just finished reading and pondering
					Emblem 11, for example, where might he go from there? Perhaps he would
					simply flip the page to follow Atalanta and Hippomones into Emblem 12,
					reading the emblems sequentially. He also might have decided to obey
					Maier’s exhortation to set aside confusing books entirely for the
					laboratory, putting down <em>Atalanta fugiens</em> and stoking a fire instead.
					On the other hand, this reader may well have chosen to remain within
					<em>Atalanta fugiens</em>, at least for the moment; that is, instead of
					proceeding from Emblem 11 to Emblem 12 (thus proceeding “in order”), he
					might have jumped from Emblem 11 into other parts of the book. He might
					have returned back to the title page, for example, where the many-headed
					dragon Ladon sits in the Garden of the Hesperides guarding the golden
					apples, to ponder yet another dimension of Maier’s play on Laton/Latona.
					[Figure 1: title page of <em>Atalanta</em>] Or, this same reader might have
					flipped ahead in the book instead from Emblem 11 to Emblem 25 [Figure
					5: Emblem 25/XXV], “The Dragon does not die, if it is not killed by its
					brother and sister, i.e. Sol and Luna.” In this emblem, we see Latona’s
					twins Sol and Luna again, now all grown up, and attempting to bludgeon a
					dragon who, we are told, “does not die if it is not killed by its
					brother and sister, i.e. Sol and Luna.” This dragon’s tail recalls
					Ladon’s on the title page, but Maier’s epigram tells us that the dragon
					here represents philosophical mercury, which can only be coagulated with
					Sol and Luna. Maier is again pointing to the laboratory, but one wonders
					how this step is related to the one in Emblem 11 before, or, for that
					matter, any of the others in between? Perhaps there is a chymical
					narrative threaded through the book after all, if one only knew how to
					find it?</p>

					<p>My point here is not to answer these questions, to “figure out” the
					secrets that Maier embedded in his complex book. Clearly, there was no
					single way to read <em>Atalanta fugiens,</em> which drew on both the genre of
					the emblem book and the alchemical <em>Bildgedicht</em> (not to mention the
					feint that it was about Atalanta and Hippomenes) to shape readers’
					expectations. In fact, the open-ended nature of <em>Atalanta fugiens</em> and
					the infinite number of links, layers, and hidden meanings embedded in it
					deliberately resists any possibility of “solving” the puzzle (although
					it is fun to try). Rather, my point is that, despite its claim to be the
					story of Atalanta and Hippomenes, the structure and content of <em>Atalanta
					fugiens</em> encourages its readers to read both vertically and
					horizontally, that is, not only to linger within a single emblem to
					consider internal connections among its visual, textual, and musical
					parts, but also to read across multiple emblems. Moreover, even this
					latter kind of horizontal reading offered numerous possibilities. One
					need not read sequentially (although one could), but could also skip
					around, flip back and forth, and construct groupings out of emblems
					otherwise dispersed throughout the book. In short, reading <em>Atalanta
					fugiens</em> for connections and juxtapositions across and within emblems
					turns the book into a tool, an instrument for multiplying meanings and
					endlessly generating new insights into nature, and possibly even
					producing valuable chymical materials in the laboratory.</p>

						<p>Maier preferred the terms <em>chymicus</em> and <em>ars chymica</em> (or, more negatively, <em>pseudo-chymicus</em>) to <em>alchemist</em> or <em>alchemie</em>.

						<p>“Hanc alii tradunt cum luna lumina solis/ Mixta, nigrae cui sint in facie maculae.” Although in this phrasing it is the mixture that is flecked with dark spots, the following sentence, as well as the German translation and discourse, make it clear that the spots are on Latona’s face, not her children. The analogy, in other words, breaks down a bit. <a href="http://diglib.hab.de/drucke/196-quod-1s/start.htm?image=00055">http://diglib.hab.de/drucke/196-quod-1s/start.htm?image=00055</a>  Accessed 14.

				<div class="article">
					<p>The multiple parts of <em>Atalanta fugiens</em> and the complicated
					relationships among them were not the only things that made reading
					Maier’s book difficult. Readers had to engage multiple parts of their
					own bodies and minds as well. After all, as Maier admonished, the book
					was to be “seen, read, reflected upon, comprehended, weighed, sung, and
					heard.”<sup class="footnote-sup is-inactive" data-footnote-trigger="14">14</sup> One needed eyes for the first two activities in this list,
					although Maier differentiated between seeing (pictures) and reading
					(words). He lists three different kinds of mental activity as well,
					noting that the book is to be reflected upon, comprehended, weighed
					(<em>meditanda, intelligenda, dijudicanda</em>). These were different facets of
					intellectual work: taking in information, determining its meaning, and
					then weighing its significance with respect to other texts, images, or
					ideas. Finally, in order to grapple with <em>Atalanta fugiens</em>, one must
					use the mouth (or a musical instrument) to produce sound, and the ear to
					consume it. As Maier put it:</p>

					 <p>In order to have as it were in a single view and embrace these three
					objects of the more spiritual senses, namely of sight, hearing and the
					intellect itself, and so as to introduce to the soul that which is to
					be understood at one and the same time, we have joined Optics to Music
					and the sense to the intellect, that is, rarities for the sight and
					hearing with the chemical emblems that are proper to this
					science.<sup class="footnote-sup is-inactive" data-footnote-trigger="15">15</sup></p>

					<p>Maier’s book deliberately engaged the intellect <em>and</em> the senses, in
					other words, and he challenged his readers to attempt to grasp chymical
					arcana with all of them at once. (The three lower perceptual faculties
					of touch, smell, and taste, are notably and deliberately absent from
					Maier’s sensorium, although as we know, plenty of people who examined
					and experimented with nature in early modern Europe used these senses as
					well.)<sup class="footnote-sup is-inactive" data-footnote-trigger="16">16</sup></p>

					<p>So why choose emblems as the best format for conveying chymical
					knowledge? In part, this was about Maier’s deep investment in chymistry
					as a privileged and difficult endeavor. In invoking the “chemical
					emblems that are proper to this science,” Maier endorsed a particular
					mode of communication as fitting for chymistry. Other “arts,” he noted,
					might communicate more directly “because they want to be, and should be,
					understood by all. Chemia is not thus, but like a chaste virgin behind a
					lattice, and like Diana, is not to be seen without a veil of various
					colors.”<sup class="footnote-sup is-inactive" data-footnote-trigger="17">17</sup> Readers who were well read in alchemical literature would
					have nodded in agreement, given many (although by no means all)
					alchemical authors’ propensity towards allegory, poetry, and rhetorical
					techniques of “dispersion” (spreading dicta over a text) and <em>Decknamen</em>
					(code names for alchemical materials).<sup class="footnote-sup is-inactive" data-footnote-trigger="18">18</sup> For Maier, this was as it
					should be. Chymistry was not simply an artisanal practice, but was meant
					to challenge the intellect, he explained, and this is why he chose to
					present it in <em>Atalanta fugiens</em> as a collection of images, allegories,
					secrets, and “musical rarities.” The reader, listener, or viewer of
					<em>Atalanta fugiens</em> would not discover the secrets within easily – he or
					she must ponder them and perhaps discuss them with others – but the
					intellectual exercise would bring rewards in the end.</p>

					<p>Moreover, Maier confesses, representing chymistry as multimedia emblem
					might have an additional benefit. It made chymistry more appealing, more
					likely to catch and hold readers’ attention, and thus eventually to
					penetrate the intellect. One must approach the intellect gently, he
					explained, and with the proper protocol: “it is necessary for everything
					knowable to be brought and made known to the intellect, as to a
					magistrate or arbitrator, first by the senses as investigators and
					messengers, like the guardians who watch at the gates (their organs) of
					some city.”<sup class="footnote-sup is-inactive" data-footnote-trigger="19">19</sup> Then, if chymical knowledge “is first entrusted to the
					sense, there is no doubt that it should be transferred from the sense to
					the intellect, as through a portal…”<sup class="footnote-sup is-inactive" data-footnote-trigger="20">20</sup> The sensory pleasures of
					<em>Atalanta fugiens</em>, in other words, could draw readers in, and then open
					the intellect to the deeper truths within. As the author’s epigram to
					<em>Atalanta fugiens</em> concluded, “These emblems are offered to your ears
					and eyes, but reason will seek out the arcana embedded in these marks
					[<em>notas</em>]. I bring them to your senses, that your intellect may grasp
					what treasures lie hidden within.”<sup class="footnote-sup is-inactive" data-footnote-trigger="21">21</sup> For all of these reasons, in
					Maier’s view, emblems were the perfect format for promoting and
					containing chymical knowledge. As a fashionable genre, emblems set as
					the social context that Maier aspired to for chymistry, making it a
					learned and entertaining subject. Emblems also allowed for a suitably
					enigmatic presentation of chymical arcana, thus allowing Maier to print
					chymical secrets without divulging them to all. Furthermore, enhanced
					with sound and image, emblems could draw people in to a subject that
					they otherwise might have avoided. The multiple advantages of emblems,
					therefore, addressed some of Maier’s concerns about chymistry’s public
					image, its social status, intellectual cache, and presence in European
					print culture.<sup class="footnote-sup is-inactive" data-footnote-trigger="22">22</sup></p>

					<p>I would like to suggest that the emblem format did something else as
					well, however. It focused Maier’s audience on an issue that was central
					not only to reading <em>Atalanta fugiens</em>, but to the search for knowledge
					more generally as well, namely how to strike the right balance between
					intellectual and sensory engagements with nature. In other words,
					learning to read about chymical arcana in emblems was also a way to
					calibrate the mind and body and ultimately, to cultivate the skills
					required to practice chymistry.</p>

				<div class="article">
					<p>In order to press his case about the proper balance between intellectual
					and sensory engagements with chymical arcana, Maier drew on late
					Renaissance understandings of philosophical psychology and
					cognition.<sup class="footnote-sup is-inactive" data-footnote-trigger="23">23</sup> Done properly, in his view, seeking “chymicall secrets”
					was one of the most dignified undertakings, second only to the pursuit
					of the divine. Drawing on a conventional Aristotelian hierarchy of the
					vegetative, sensitive, and intellective souls, Maier began the preface
					to <em>Atalanta fugiens</em> by explaining, “Man, gentle reader, is by general
					consent held to be in his composition a compendium of the universe, and
					to be destined to live a life of the triple kind,” vegetable, sensible,
					and intelligible. In the “maternal womb,” he lives a “vegetable life,”
					growing “not much differently from a plant.” In “this world,” he lives a
					“sensible life,” mostly guided by his senses, distinguished from animals
					only “in that be begins to use his senses, albeit imperfectly.” Finally,
					“in the other world which is God’s,” he lives “the intelligible life”
					alongside the angels. <em>Atalanta fugiens</em> addressed the middle field,
					that is, the “sensible life,” where humans can make use of both the
					“intellect” and the “corporeal senses.” Using the intellect, he says,
					“those more learned men, devoted to the refined arts and sciences” may
					approach the divine and pursue “subtle, wondrous, and rare things.” On
					the other hand, “those more numerous men given to bodily pleasures,
					lust, gluttony, external pomp, and suchlike things” limit themselves to
					the use of the senses, and thus to the “genus of beasts.”<sup class="footnote-sup is-inactive" data-footnote-trigger="24">24</sup></p>

					<p>Naturally, Maier envisioned himself and his readers to be among those
					“more learned men, devoted to the refined arts and sciences,” and he
					offered <em>Atalanta fugiens</em> as an instrument with which to pursue these
					aims. “To cultivate the intellect,” he explained, “God concealed
					infinite <em>arcana</em> in nature, which are found out by innumerable arts and
					sciences, as fire out of a flint, and transferred to use.”<sup class="footnote-sup is-inactive" data-footnote-trigger="25">25</sup> The
					interest in arcana was widespread among scholars and printers in the
					sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, and Maier wanted to make it clear
					that chymistry, too, had secrets to offer.<sup class="footnote-sup is-inactive" data-footnote-trigger="26">26</sup> In his view, however,
					true chymical arcana were not mere recipes or techniques, the arcana
					peddled by what he called “those wandering deceivers and pseudo-chemical
					frauds (who in these matters are like the ass with the lyre, as alien as
					can be from all good doctrine and intention).”<sup class="footnote-sup is-inactive" data-footnote-trigger="27">27</sup> True chymical
					arcana, in Maier’s view, were not for sale, but were rather a divine
					gift to help humans develop their higher faculties. In fact, chymical
					arcana were the best secrets for this task. “The secrets of chymistry
					are not last among these [secrets that God concealed in Nature],” he
					proclaimed, but the first and most precious after the searching out of
					divine things.”<sup class="footnote-sup is-inactive" data-footnote-trigger="28">28</sup></p>

					<p>In Maier’s hierarchy of cognitive engagements with the world, he clearly
					privileged the intellect. As Maier explained in his preface to <em>Atalanta
					fugiens</em>, true chymical secrets are “to be grasped by the intellect
					sooner than by sense, by profound contemplation upon the reading of
					authors, and comparing them together and with the works of nature,
					rather than by sensitive operation, or manual experimentation, which is
					blind without previous theory.”<sup class="footnote-sup is-inactive" data-footnote-trigger="29">29</sup> Maier certainly did not call for a
					purely “intellectual” practice of alchemy, even as he does call for a
					methodical reading practice that includes “profound contemplation” of
					books. His claim, rather, is that the search for chymical secrets cannot
					succeed with the senses alone. Maier juxtaposed two different approaches
					to chymical knowledge. One method is to combine textual and laboratory
					practices, reading, reflecting upon, and comparing texts within the
					alchemical corpus and placing insights from books into conversation with
					“the works of nature.” For Maier, this careful reading and toggling
					between books and direct sensory engagement with nature was preferable
					to the other method, namely eschewing books in favor of “sensitive
					operation, or manual experimentation” alone, which he saw as “blind”
					because it lacked a theoretical framework.</p>

					<p>Maier expanded on this idea in the emblem we have already examined,
					Emblem 11, “Make Latona White and Rip Up the Books.” [Figure 4: Emblem
					11] There he acknowledged some of the limitations of approaching
					chymistry through books alone. By 1600 or so, the corpus of chymical
					texts was overwhelming and confusing. Not only was there a growing
					number of ancient, medieval, and now early modern texts, but reading
					them was difficult because of inconsistent terminology and sometimes
					riddling prose style. “The variety of writings of the authors is so
					great, that searchers after truth would despair of reaching the ultimate
					aim of the art,” Maier noted in the discourse to Emblem 11. “The
					allegorical stories in themselves are already difficult to understand
					and are the cause of many errors,” he continued, “still the more so when
					the same expressions are used for different things, and different
					expressions for the same things.” All of this made it difficult to
					locate “the truth hidden under so many obscurities” and to “sift what is
					truth and what is not.” And so, Maier advised, quoting an injunction
					that appeared in other alchemical texts as well, “the books should be
					ripped apart, so that hearts may not be destroyed.” In other words, as
					the motto to Emblem 11 proclaims, the aspiring alchemist should “rip up
					the books,” and dispense with misleading or confusing [<em>ambiguous</em>]
					books that only cause anguish.<sup class="footnote-sup is-inactive" data-footnote-trigger="30">30</sup></p>

					<p>Maier’s advice in this emblem is a bit dramatic, to be sure (and
					certainly he did not intend for his readers to tear <em>Atalanta fugiens</em>
					apart!). His point is not that alchemical texts will always mislead and
					thus should be set aside entirely, but rather that they can be
					difficult, and, more importantly, that the laboratory can help the
					chymist navigate the library. “A clear intellect is not sufficient
					without manual labor, nor manual labor without a clear mind,” he states
					directly; “theory is not sufficient without practice and vice versa.”
					The key to chymical clarity is balance, following Nature and gaining
					“experientia” on the one hand, and careful, deliberative reading
					[<em>studio et lectio authorum</em>] on the other. Each frames questions and
					clarifies the findings of the other, whether in books or in nature
					itself. And, as I have already suggested, the other elements of Emblem
					11 underscore the importance of the laboratory by pointing the reader to
					practice (in this case, whitening and purifying an impure alloy as a
					step towards producing the philosophers’ stone and, ultimately, gold and
					silver.)<sup class="footnote-sup is-inactive" data-footnote-trigger="31">31</sup></p>

					<p>Maier returned to these themes again in Emblem 42, echoing and
					developing his argument that the true <em>chymist</em> must be guided by the
					interplay of theory and practice. [Figure6 : Emblem 42] Emblem 42 is
					one of Maier’s more repetitive emblems, with image, text, and music all
					reiterating the point first made in the motto: “Nature, reason,
					experience and reading must be guide, staff, spectacles, and lamp to him
					that is employed in chymical affairs.”<sup class="footnote-sup is-inactive" data-footnote-trigger="32">32</sup> The image reinforces the
					motto by depicting the chymist, a bearded man equipped with staff,
					spectacles, and a lamp, following in the footsteps of Nature
					personified. As the accompanying discourse elaborates, the chymist is
					like a traveler. He needs “First, a competent guide guarding him against
					errors; secondly a solid stick, which prevents him from slipping on the
					slippery road; thirdly good eyesight, and fourthly a lamp or a burning
					torch so that he may distinguish the partings of the ways…namely,
					<em>Natura, Ratio, Experientia</em>, and <em>Lectio</em>.”<sup class="footnote-sup is-inactive" data-footnote-trigger="33">33</sup> Natura, in other
					words, provides not only the raw materials necessary for the chymist’s
					art, but also exemplars of how these materials behave. Ratio, the staff,
					prevents the Chymist from stumbling, helping him sort out true from
					untrue, and Experientia, the spectacles, assist him in observing and
					thus building up a store of knowledge. Finally, Lectio, reading, is the
					lamp, “without which there would be only darkness and dense fogs.”<sup class="footnote-sup is-inactive" data-footnote-trigger="34">34</sup>
					Maier not only underscores the importance of choosing good books, but
					takes the opportunity to address proper reading practices. One must read
					books repeatedly and patiently, he argues, for quick, superficial
					reading will only lead to failure and confusion. Likening these four
					elements of the Chymist’s practice to a vehicle that allows the chymist
					to travel the path of Philosophical Medicine, Maier emphasizes that all
					must be present in order to make progress; “if one of the wheels is
					missing, the other three are no longer of any use.”<sup class="footnote-sup is-inactive" data-footnote-trigger="35">35</sup> The music in
					this emblem reinforces this message as well. Emblem 42 is one of the few
					emblems that departs from the standard order: Apple, then Atalanta, then
					Hippomenes. Rather, in this fugue, for the first time, two of the voices
					(Atalanta and the Apple) sing in unison, momentarily suspending the
					canon format of the book. [Audio 1: Fugue 42] Moreover, all three
					voices sing in even quarter notes, suggesting that they are now
					proceeding in lock step. Hippomenes, in other words, is apace with
					Atalanta and her apple, just as the chymist steps right in the footsteps
					of Nature.<sup class="footnote-sup is-inactive" data-footnote-trigger="36">36</sup></p>

					<p>Armed with both spectacles and a lamp, the chymist in Emblem 42 draws
					particular attention to the sense of sight. Historians are not
					accustomed to thinking of alchemists as individuals with particular
					visual expertise. We associate the trained eye much more closely with
					the naturalist combing the landscape for specimens of plants, for
					example, or with the physician, whose ability to differentiate among
					numerous shades of yellow was central to the practice of uroscopy.<sup class="footnote-sup is-inactive" data-footnote-trigger="37">37</sup>
					Yet alchemists, too, relied heavily on sight in their practice,
					scrutinizing color changes, the rise and fall of vapors, and the
					qualities and location of solid matter in their retorts as purveyors of
					crucial information about the progress of the transformations they hoped
					to effect, as well as signs of how and when to intervene in those
					processes.<sup class="footnote-sup is-inactive" data-footnote-trigger="38">38</sup></p>

					<p>Some of the iconography around alchemy acknowledged the importance of
					visual acuity for practitioners, both in a positive and negative way.
					Alembics, retorts, and flasks appear prominently in early modern
					representations of the alchemist in his laboratory, who often is
					depicted peering into these glass vessels – or, more pointedly,
					decidedly ignoring that glassware, as if neglecting to carefully monitor
					the contents within, or simply not seeing what was important about them,
					is itself a sign of faulty practice. [Figure 7: Teniers, “The Alchemist
					in His Workshop”] Even in the more straightforward satires of the
					alchemist as the “pseudo-chymical drone” whom Maier despised, vision
					plays a prominent role in highlighting failure and folly. <em>Von der
					Artzney bayder Glück</em>, for example, the 1532 German edition of
					Petrarch’s <em>De remediis utriusque fortunae,</em> concludes a denunciation of
					the folly of alchemy by noting that, “In the end many [alchemists]
					lose first intellectual vision [<em>augen des gemuts</em>] and then the use
					of their physical eyes [<em>ubung die leyplichen augen</em>] to boot.”<sup class="footnote-sup is-inactive" data-footnote-trigger="39">39</sup>
					The accompanying image to this passage shows the alchemist in
					spectacles, his failing eyes an external, bodily manifestation of
					failing intellect, destroyed by the foolish pursuit of alchemy. [Figure
					8: Petrarch, <em>Von der Artzney bayder Glück,</em> image just before p.
					CXXXII]</p>

					<p>Maier attempts to flip this critique on its head, however. In Emblem 42,
					he places spectacles on his chymist not to represent not weak, failing
					eyes, but rather the power of “art” to bolster the chymist’s insights
					into nature. “<em>Experientia</em> will be the spectacles, with which the
					things that are far away can be seen close up,” Maier explains; “these
					are the optical instruments invented and made by art, which come to the
					aid of man’s weak eyes and correct them.” Just as spectacles or
					telescopes extend the limited sense of sight, he proposes, so, too, must
					chymists turn to “art” – “<em>experimenta</em> with mineral matters” – to build
					up their “experiences” of nature (in the conventional Aristotelian sense
					of a store of memories that allow one eventually to build up
					understanding). “The more of these experiences one remembers the more
					reasonable deliberation will be able to make mutual comparisons in order
					to distinguish truth from untruth.”<sup class="footnote-sup is-inactive" data-footnote-trigger="40">40</sup> In short, Maier’s spectacles
					represent the chymist’s laboratory practice, the “<em>experimenta</em> with
					mineral matters” that allow him to build up an understanding of nature
					and thus to better grasp the chymical arcana concealed in nature. The
					chymical eye that <em>Atalanta fugiens</em> invokes, in other words, is not
					simply the sense of sight, but rather intellectual insight. The book
					equips readers with spectacles of their own, as it were, by pointing
					practitioners to the laboratory to carry out their own
					<em>experimenta</em>.<sup class="footnote-sup is-inactive" data-footnote-trigger="41">41</sup></p>

					<p>But what about the music? Did Maier hope to cultivate a chymical ear, as
					well as a chymical eye? Maier was less explicit about how singing and
					hearing the music in <em>Atalanta fugiens</em> might translate into chymical
					practice, but he did address music generally in his Preface to the
					Reader, underscoring the importance of music, “both vocal and
					instrumental,” in antiquity. Greek philosophers, he noted, regarded as
					ignorant anyone who “refused the lyre at feasts,” highlighting the
					sociability of music performance, and perhaps hinting at how his own
					fugues should be sung in social settings. Maier also pointed out how
					essential music was to education for Socrates, Plato (who, Maier
					commented, “stated that one is not put together harmoniously who does
					not rejoice in Music’s harmony”), and, of course to Pythagoras, “who is
					said to have used musical symphonies morning and evening to compose the
					spirits of his disciples.”<sup class="footnote-sup is-inactive" data-footnote-trigger="42">42</sup> Music, then, could promote sociability
					and exemplify harmony, but it could also set the appropriate mood for
					study. It was the power of music to influence the hearer’s disposition
					(<em>affectus</em>), that especially interested Maier, and that offers a clue
					to how he might have imagined the sense of hearing to be related to the
					practice of chymistry. “For Music has this peculiar power,” he wrote,
					“that it excites or calms the affections, according to the different
					musical modes” (what we now think of as scales with their characteristic
					melodies).<sup class="footnote-sup is-inactive" data-footnote-trigger="43">43</sup> The Phyrigian mode, for example, akin to the modern
					minor scale, was “bellicose, because it incites to war and to battle,”
					whereas the Ionian mode, or a modern major scale, had the opposite
					effect, producing “amity” and calm. Maier’s implication here was that,
					just as music could set the appropriate mood for students, warriors, and
					diplomats to carry out their work, so too could it prepare the chymist’s
					body and mind to explore nature’s secrets.</p>

					<p>In making this claim, Maier drew on a long tradition, from Orpheus to
					the Renaissance magus Cornelius Agrippa that positioned music as an
					important part of prayer, healing, natural magic, and the dispelling of
					evil spirits.<sup class="footnote-sup is-inactive" data-footnote-trigger="44">44</sup> This particular use of music was rare in an
					alchemical context, although it was quite prominent in the work of the
					Paracelsian physician and author Heinrich Khunrath, who invitingly
					placed a pile of musical instruments smack in the middle of one of the
					most elaborate images associated with alchemy, his <em>Lab-Oratorium,</em>
					which appeared in Khunrath’s <em>Amphitheatrum sapientae aeternae</em>
					1595/1609, shortly before <em>Atalanta fugiens.</em> [Figure: Khunrath
					Amphitheater image] Peter Forshaw has explored at length the role of
					music in this image, arguing that Khunrath’s instruments allude to
					numerical concepts of weight, number, and proportion (in this case, of
					chymical materials), as well as to the harmonious balance between theory
					and practice, heaven and earth, and spirit and matter.<sup class="footnote-sup is-inactive" data-footnote-trigger="45">45</sup> Khunrath was
					also interested in the musical modes in the context of sacred music and
					theurgic ritual, however, a subject that the “oratory” half of his image
					explores.</p>

					<p>Maier borrowed liberally from Khunrath in his writings,<sup class="footnote-sup is-inactive" data-footnote-trigger="46">46</sup> so he may
					well have been responding in some way to Khunrath’s complex imagery.
					Just as significant, however, is the fact that Maier’s melodies are not,
					as they may appear, Maier’s original compositions, but are, rather,
					quotes of existing liturgical melodies. For the apple’s <em>cantus firmus</em>
					that is present in all fifty fugues, Maier used a liturgical melody, the
					Kyrie <em>Cunctipotens genitor deus</em>, a Gregorian chant setting for the
					Mass ordinary. Helen Joy Sleeper first identified this as the apple part
					in 1938, describing the <em>Cunctipotens genitor deus</em> as “one of the most
					familiar of church melodies, and one, moreover, employed by composers
					from an anonymous eleventh or twelfth century writer to Frescobaldi in
					the seventeenth century.”<sup class="footnote-sup is-inactive" data-footnote-trigger="47">47</sup> But Maier had a more specific source for
					using the Kyrie in this way, overlaid with a two-voice canon. As Loren
					Ludwig argues in his essay for this volume [link to LOREN], Maier took
					the first forty fugues in <em>Atalanta fugiens</em> from a collection of short,
					three-part vocal pieces, or “waies,” published by the English composer
					John Farmer in 1591.<sup class="footnote-sup is-inactive" data-footnote-trigger="48">48</sup> If the canonic interaction of the three voices
					purports to tells the story of the contest between Atalanta and
					Hippomenes, therefore, the actual melodies they sing point to liturgical
					music and suggest a Christian, rather than classical, context for
					Maier’s book.<sup class="footnote-sup is-inactive" data-footnote-trigger="49">49</sup> On one level, Maier’s choice of melodies underscored
					the notion of chymical arcana as a way to approach the divine. But if
					music was important to Maier because it prepared the chymist’s
					<em>affectus</em>, then we must also understand his fugues not as a narrative
					technique, or part of his elaborate game in <em>Atalanta fugiens</em>, but also
					as part of the deliberate, careful training of senses and intellect,
					body and mind, that he viewed as necessary to practice chymistry
					properly.</p>

					<p>I have suggested that the multimedia emblems in Maier’s original edition
					of <em>Atalanta fugiens</em> were, among other things, an epistemological tool
					and a meditation on the relationship between the intellect and the
					senses of sight and hearing in the practice of chymistry. In focusing
					his readers on this issue by using format of the musical emblem book,
					Maier asked them to prepare their minds and their bodies to grapple with
					chymistry. Whether reading books or carrying out laboratory practices,
					Maier’s chymist engaged his entire body, including the intellect. Only
					then could he hope to grasp the chymical arcana that God had placed in
					nature to develop his intellect and lift him above the beasts.</p>

					<p>Seventy years after Maier published <em>Atalanta fugiens</em>, however, it was
					possible to imagine chymistry without this entire corporal edifice. When
					Georg Heinrich Oehrling republished Maier’s masterpiece in 1687, he did
					so without the music at all, keeping only the images with their
					associated Latin mottos and epigrams and even editing out the references
					to music from Maier’s preface.<sup class="footnote-sup is-inactive" data-footnote-trigger="50">50</sup> [Figure 9: 1687 cover, or link to
					Donna’s essay] In eliminating the music, the 1687 edition jettisoned
					the most complicated and demanding elements in <em>Atalanta fugiens</em>,
					namely the interplay of myth and chymistry, returning Maier’s book to a
					more conventional emblem format and reducing it to an illustrated
					collection of alchemical dicta. In silencing the music, the 1687 also
					stripped Maier’s chymistry of its sacred context; the chymist might
					still need his eyes and intellect, but he no longer needed sacred music
					to prepare his disposition to understand nature’s secrets properly. It
					is tempting to say that “chymistry” was on its way to becoming
					“chemistry,” increasingly focused on the material engagement with nature
					in the laboratory, rather than on an outmoded resonance between nature
					and the divine or the remote classical past. Perhaps. But in discarding
					Maier’s vision of a fully embodied chymical practice, the 1687 edition
					of <em>Atalanta fugiens</em> may also have unmoored chymistry (or at least the
					project of the philosopher’s stone) from the senses, turning it into a
					primarily intellectual and literary practice, and thus also paving the
					way for its abstraction the nineteenth century and absorption into “the
					occult.”<sup class="footnote-sup is-inactive" data-footnote-trigger="51">51</sup></p>
